A debate has broken out among the tech wings in my area. I am turning to Reddit to settle the debate.\\n\\nIs it still considered best practice to have an external email warning on your emails?\\n\\nIn case you have no idea what I'm talking about, I mean a little warning box at the top of an email warning your user that the email has originated from outside of the company, so be cautious clicking any links or opening attachments.\\n\\nAt one time this was widely used and I know some orgs still do.  A lot of companies seem to be moving away from it too.   What are your thoughts r/sysadmin?\\n\\nThe side against it is basically saying that after a while users will just be used to seeing it all the time and ignore it. Or even worse just blindly trust any email that comes through without the warning.\\n\\nThey seem to think that we should train the users to be suspicious of every mail whether interal or external.\\n\\n**EDIT:** added what the side against was saying for clarity.

During these calls, an individual claiming to be from Telegram attempted to verify my account. Fortunately, I did not disclose the verification code, as I recognized the scam. Nonetheless, it is evident that they were actively listening, as they eventually discontinued their efforts after I explicitly expressed my refusal to be deceived. What troubles me is their usage of my complete legal name, despite its lack of association with any of my accounts.\\n\\n\\nCamera Hacked Via Telegram (audio ON)\\n\\nIn the second video, a sequence of screenshots inadvertently captured the camera being activated. It was only towards the end that I noticed this occurrence, prompting me to create a screen recording to document the situation. The recording clearly demonstrates that the Telegram app was accessing the camera on my phone, despite my not actively taking any pictures. Interestingly, as soon as I initiate a screen recording, Telegram disconnects, causing the green dot indicating camera usage to disappear. However, once the app reconnects, the green dot reappears as well.\\n\\nI have so many more examples..\",\n          \"NoFilter Attack: Sneaky Privilege Escalation Method Bypasses Windows Security.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Prediction\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1997,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"148062.26.00\",\n          \"1410275.36.00\",\n          \"163415.58.00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Old Related\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1.0\",\n          \"0.0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Checked\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Related\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":22}],"source":["from google.auth import default\n","creds, _ = default()\n","\n","gs = gspread.authorize(creds)\n","\n","\n","worksheet = gs.open_by_url(active_learning_dir).sheet1\n","\n","rows = worksheet.get_all_values()\n","\n","active_learning_df = pd.DataFrame(rows)\n","active_learning_df = active_learning_df.iloc[1:, 1:]\n","active_learning_df.columns = nuovi_nomi_colonne\n","\n","active_learning_df\n"],"id":"rUtivNC-mvjY"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["active_learning_df = active_learning_df[active_learning_df['Checked'] == '1']\n","active_learning_df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"id":"vZSLw0sgmvGk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708468341929,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":241,"user":{"displayName":"Leonardo Giusti","userId":"10453788555175165530"}},"outputId":"ab400f6e-6e48-4081-a70c-07e30392a4d4"},"id":"vZSLw0sgmvGk","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                          original_text  \\\n","1     Accidentally clicked on a link in job email, m...   \n","2     Vulnerabilities in Supermicro BMCs could allow...   \n","3     Can't create an email as it both exists and do...   \n","4     Kohberger’s defense team runs parallel investi...   \n","5     Microsoft Ticking Timebombs - March 2023 Editi...   \n","...                                                 ...   \n","1996  Hi Guys Am I safe?.

A debate has broken out among the tech wings in my area. I am turning to Reddit to settle the debate.\\n\\nIs it still considered best practice to have an external email warning on your emails?\\n\\nIn case you have no idea what I'm talking about, I mean a little warning box at the top of an email warning your user that the email has originated from outside of the company, so be cautious clicking any links or opening attachments.\\n\\nAt one time this was widely used and I know some orgs still do.  A lot of companies seem to be moving away from it too.   What are your thoughts r/sysadmin?\\n\\nThe side against it is basically saying that after a while users will just be used to seeing it all the time and ignore it.

During these calls, an individual claiming to be from Telegram attempted to verify my account. Fortunately, I did not disclose the verification code, as I recognized the scam. Nonetheless, it is evident that they were actively listening, as they eventually discontinued their efforts after I explicitly expressed my refusal to be deceived. What troubles me is their usage of my complete legal name, despite its lack of association with any of my accounts.\\n\\n\\nCamera Hacked Via Telegram (audio ON)\\n\\nIn the second video, a sequence of screenshots inadvertently captured the camera being activated. It was only towards the end that I noticed this occurrence, prompting me to create a screen recording to document the situation. The recording clearly demonstrates that the Telegram app was accessing the camera on my phone, despite my not actively taking any pictures. Interestingly, as soon as I initiate a screen recording, Telegram disconnects, causing the green dot indicating camera usage to disappear. However, once the app reconnects, the green dot reappears as well.\\n\\nI have so many more examples..\",\n          \"NoFilter Attack: Sneaky Privilege Escalation Method Bypasses Windows Security.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Prediction\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1997,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"148062.26.00\",\n          \"1410275.36.00\",\n          \"163415.58.00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Old Related\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1.0\",\n          \"0.0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Checked\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Related\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":23}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["active_learning_df['Related'] = pd.to_numeric(active_learning_df['Related'], errors='coerce')\n","active_learning_df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"id":"dxWqV3GgpsWM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708468442834,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":236,"user":{"displayName":"Leonardo Giusti","userId":"10453788555175165530"}},"outputId":"1fa2f5bd-aa5c-4fad-ea84-9bf717d50227"},"id":"dxWqV3GgpsWM","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                          original_text  \\\n","1     Accidentally clicked on a link in job email, m...   \n","2     Vulnerabilities in Supermicro BMCs could allow...   \n","3     Can't create an email as it both exists and do...   \n","4     Kohberger’s defense team runs parallel investi...   \n","5     Microsoft Ticking Timebombs - March 2023 Editi...   \n","...                                                 ...   \n","1996  Hi Guys Am I safe?.

A debate has broken out among the tech wings in my area. I am turning to Reddit to settle the debate.\\n\\nIs it still considered best practice to have an external email warning on your emails?\\n\\nIn case you have no idea what I'm talking about, I mean a little warning box at the top of an email warning your user that the email has originated from outside of the company, so be cautious clicking any links or opening attachments.\\n\\nAt one time this was widely used and I know some orgs still do.  A lot of companies seem to be moving away from it too.   What are your thoughts r/sysadmin?\\n\\nThe side against it is basically saying that after a while users will just be used to seeing it all the time and ignore it. Or even worse just blindly trust any email that comes through without the warning.\\n\\nThey seem to think that we should train the users to be suspicious of every mail whether interal or external.\\n\\n**EDIT:** added what the side against was saying for clarity.

During these calls, an individual claiming to be from Telegram attempted to verify my account. Fortunately, I did not disclose the verification code, as I recognized the scam. Nonetheless, it is evident that they were actively listening, as they eventually discontinued their efforts after I explicitly expressed my refusal to be deceived. What troubles me is their usage of my complete legal name, despite its lack of association with any of my accounts.\\n\\n\\nCamera Hacked Via Telegram (audio ON)\\n\\nIn the second video, a sequence of screenshots inadvertently captured the camera being activated. It was only towards the end that I noticed this occurrence, prompting me to create a screen recording to document the situation. The recording clearly demonstrates that the Telegram app was accessing the camera on my phone, despite my not actively taking any pictures. Interestingly, as soon as I initiate a screen recording, Telegram disconnects, causing the green dot indicating camera usage to disappear. However, once the app reconnects, the green dot reappears as well.\\n\\nI have so many more examples..\",\n          \"NoFilter Attack: Sneaky Privilege Escalation Method Bypasses Windows Security.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Prediction\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1997,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"148062.26.00\",\n          \"1410275.36.00\",\n          \"163415.58.00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Old Related\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1.0\",\n          \"0.0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Checked\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Related\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 11,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":24}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["X2 = active_learning_df[['original_text', 'Related']]\n","X2 = X2.rename(columns={'original_text': 'full_text'})\n","X2"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"id":"uiK3S9Myp-Y8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708468605198,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":242,"user":{"displayName":"Leonardo Giusti","userId":"10453788555175165530"}},"outputId":"2d9183fc-2afa-4c6c-b94b-6867e6cef67a"},"id":"uiK3S9Myp-Y8","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                              full_text  Related\n","1     Accidentally clicked on a link in job email, m...        1\n","2     Vulnerabilities in Supermicro BMCs could allow...        1\n","3     Can't create an email as it both exists and do...        0\n","4     Kohberger’s defense team runs parallel investi...        0\n","5     Microsoft Ticking Timebombs - March 2023 Editi...        1\n","...                                                 ...      ...\n","1996  Hi Guys Am I safe?.

A debate has broken out among the tech wings in my area. I am turning to Reddit to settle the debate.\\n\\nIs it still considered best practice to have an external email warning on your emails?\\n\\nIn case you have no idea what I'm talking about, I mean a little warning box at the top of an email warning your user that the email has originated from outside of the company, so be cautious clicking any links or opening attachments.\\n\\nAt one time this was widely used and I know some orgs still do.  A lot of companies seem to be moving away from it too.   What are your thoughts r/sysadmin?\\n\\nThe side against it is basically saying that after a while users will just be used to seeing it all the time and ignore it. Or even worse just blindly trust any email that comes through without the warning.\\n\\nThey seem to think that we should train the users to be suspicious of every mail whether interal or external.\\n\\n**EDIT:** added what the side against was saying for clarity.

Hi all, I'd like to say I'm new to this subreddit, though I wanna ask for help. \\n\\nI was trying to find a way to download a DMC game onto my laptop from steamunlocked, I found one that I thought was fine but I clicked on a download link that downloaded malware onto my pc. \\nThinking that it was the file (it was not) it opened up and nothing happened. It wasn't until a bit later when I saw a program called \\\"PC accelerate\\\" running, which was when I realized my mistake. \\n\\nI watched a YouTube tutorial on how to delete the file and ended up uninstalling it, the last step of the video said to restart my pc and I did. As I restarted it, I opened my pc and ended up with it freezing during the start up. (I'm thinking about disabling the starting up apps like Discord and Spotify if I'm able to)\\n\\nAnyway, I just wanna ask for help because I'm kind of panicking. I don't want my pc to end up dying on me because I acted like an idiot and it's willing to kill itself over a startup. \\nHow can I counteract it freezing over? And any of you think that this could be because of the malware? I'd like to know.\",\n          \"Just got this, what do you think, legit?.

I have a Netgear GS728TPPv2 that I added to the Insight Cloud Portal. We are currently building a new network in our building while keeping the old network setup active. I put the ISP line into a dummy switch that had a line going to the old network setup to keep the building tenants live and a line to the new setup so I can work on configuring the new network switches. I was working on adding vlans to the ports so that some only had the external traffic straight from the ISP and some ports only had network traffic for an internal trusted network that comes from a watchguard firewall. Everything was working great until I made port 1 (where the isp comes into the switch) a tagged port with the external vlan (999) and management vlan (1). The moment I did that, the switch lost connection to the cloud AND it \\\"broke\\\" the internet for all tenants on the old network set up. See the attached network diagram for more details. Now I wiped the GS728TPPv2 and removed it from the cloud. Even from factory default settings, the moment I connect the GS728TPPv2 to the dummy switch, it breaks the internet for the users on the old network. How do I fix this loop/routing issue? I have a detailed Network diagram but it wont let me attach the pdf.

I firmly am of the belief that if someone polymorphs it doesn't mean they just automatically know how to act like an animal and go completely unnoticed.\\n\\nThe person I was talking to believes that as long as the polymorph \\\"fits in\\\" enough then that should not be a point of tension.\\n\\nWhat do you think?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":54}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"HfT2RaSVlRnv"},"id":"HfT2RaSVlRnv","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["path_text = \"/content/gdrive/MyDrive/ActiveLearning/content.csv\"\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"_Kf9bekqk_2L"},"id":"_Kf9bekqk_2L","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["path_X = \"/content/gdrive/MyDrive/ActiveLearning/embeddings.csv\"\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"PkIbdAnbx7nw"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"PkIbdAnbx7nw"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Save X's embeddings train, test and val to CSV\n","import numpy as np\n","np.savetxt(path_X, X, delimiter=',')\n"],"metadata":{"id":"54l6rfLRx7n8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"54l6rfLRx7n8"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Save df to CSV\n","\n","savings.to_csv(path_text)"],"metadata":{"id":"5K1U6WE-k_y7"},"id":"5K1U6WE-k_y7","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"ToYP593S3C8N"},"id":"ToYP593S3C8N","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"pjlP3nqwhxW3"},"id":"pjlP3nqwhxW3","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"m00QMy_rhxT9"},"id":"m00QMy_rhxT9","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"_XBEWifENjki"},"outputs":[],"source":[],"id":"_XBEWifENjki"},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"kMpo3kW4OiP1"},"id":"kMpo3kW4OiP1","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.5"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":418.715336,"end_time":"2022-12-04T15:05:21.058802","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2022-12-04T14:58:22.343466","version":"2.3.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
