Hey folks,\\n\\nI was wondering how one should setup a backup solution for a standard kubernetes cluster, I'm using Hetzner Cloud which offers volumes but is fairly limited, each volume must be at least 10G large and and there is no integrated backup. So I tried longhorn which has a really neat backup/snapshot solution, the only down side is that the installation is fairly complex because it only works with locally mounted volumes, but not with existing storageclasses like rook does. \\n\\nSo my next try was rook, setup was really smooth because it just uses the existing storageclass from hetzner. However, rook doesn't include a backup solution so I searched a bit and was really disappointed, which is the reason why I'm writing this post. \\n\\nThe only \\\"real\\\" backup solutions I could find was Kasten, Stash and Velero. By real I mean, has a somewhat reputable company behind it, not a hobby project on github that hasn't been updated in years. Kasten is of the table because it's only free for up to 5 nodes. Stash works kind of but is cumbersome to setup because you need to create a bunch of crds for every workload you deploy. Velero only worked for the manifests, but I could t get it to backup actual pvcs. \\n\\nI understand that backing up pvcs was hard a few years ago, because you had to use rwx volumes or inject a sidecar into the pods to read the data. But we have CSI and VolumeSnapshots now, so shouldn't it be easy to just periodically create snapshots and mount those into a restic container which saves the data to s3? Is it really that simple and just nobody has done it or am I missing something here? I have the feeling that there are mainly two kinds of people: the professionals that have the money for completely managed solutions, and the hobbyist that don't care about backups.

(Unfortunately only Windows 11 will have good support for that initially. The Anandtech article linked below mentions that Linux won't have good support for it initially; Intel hasn't finished working on Linux patches to send upstream. So we might have naive thread scheduling on Alder Lake Linux systems for a while\\n\\nSince that was over two years ago, I'm curious to know if Linux is now able to leverage Intel Thread Director, or otherwise utilize P- and E-cores differentially to maximize both performance and efficiency similar to Windows.\",\n          \"Issue with Acer Aspire 3, broken registry items and who knows what else..

So I have my home network setup like shown below. I have my Main Router connected to my ISP. I have a shop about 200' away I needed Wifi in so I did the setup below. I bought a KuWfi Bridge from amazon, and reconfigured them so they would match my network (192.168.1.x). I bought a used router, same model as my Home Router (Linksys MR8300) and configured it to 'Bridge Mode' and deployed to the shop. I have good connectivity to the internet this way, but my problem is that I cant see what devices are connected to the shop router (Linksys interface in 'Bridge Mode' blocks advanced features). I can see what all is connected to the main router, but nothing is showing up that is connected to the shop router, i thought bridge mode was supposed to make them all show up together? Any help or ideas would be great..\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vxct48ogdzb1.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dadf7d981c8675c7384bfb5c576c8c2d25a272d4\",\n          \"Old laptop as a dedicated media streaming pc. Hello! I have an older laptop, around 2015 and id like to dedicate it specifically to content streaming. Im planning on putting it in my familys living room, and letting my entire family use it. Its an amd dualcore apu with 16gbs of ram. I was just going to put it behind the tv and link it with an hdmi cable.\\n\\nThe only issue is, I don't have the money for a vpn at the moment, so downloading media is out of the question, although eventually its going to be a jellyfin server. I also have kids in the house, and as much as I'd like to just like to throw on a web browser and tell them to ignore the nsfw ads, that wont fly either. \\n\\nWhat I was wondering is if there was preferably an OS I could run that is dedicated to scraping websites, (which I understand there probably isnt, but worth the ask) or a linux application I could run on a bare bones install specifically for scraping videos, something like aniyomi without the anime focus. Im just trying to save my family from getting a firestick or android tv box.\\n\\nOr, if its at all possible, running pihole along with a web browser so I can avoid these poor innocent eyes from seeing NSFW ads. This will be my first project like this, and I know pretty much nothing, but totally willing to learn anything. Any ideas or input would be very appreciated, thanks!\",\n          \"Tenda Wireless Adapter giving poor speed.

So I have my home network setup like shown below. I have my Main Router connected to my ISP. I have a shop about 200' away I needed Wifi in so I did the setup below. I bought a KuWfi Bridge from amazon, and reconfigured them so they would match my network (192.168.1.x). I bought a used router, same model as my Home Router (Linksys MR8300) and configured it to 'Bridge Mode' and deployed to the shop. I have good connectivity to the internet this way, but my problem is that I cant see what devices are connected to the shop router (Linksys interface in 'Bridge Mode' blocks advanced features). I can see what all is connected to the main router, but nothing is showing up that is connected to the shop router, i thought bridge mode was supposed to make them all show up together?

Hello! I have an older laptop, around 2015 and id like to dedicate it specifically to content streaming. Im planning on putting it in my familys living room, and letting my entire family use it. Its an amd dualcore apu with 16gbs of ram. I was just going to put it behind the tv and link it with an hdmi cable.\\n\\nThe only issue is, I don't have the money for a vpn at the moment, so downloading media is out of the question, although eventually its going to be a jellyfin server. I also have kids in the house, and as much as I'd like to just like to throw on a web browser and tell them to ignore the nsfw ads, that wont fly either. \\n\\nWhat I was wondering is if there was preferably an OS I could run that is dedicated to scraping websites, (which I understand there probably isnt, but worth the ask) or a linux application I could run on a bare bones install specifically for scraping videos, something like aniyomi without the anime focus. Im just trying to save my family from getting a firestick or android tv box.\\n\\nOr, if its at all possible, running pihole along with a web browser so I can avoid these poor innocent eyes from seeing NSFW ads. This will be my first project like this, and I know pretty much nothing, but totally willing to learn anything. Any ideas or input would be very appreciated, thanks!\",\n          \"Tenda Wireless Adapter giving poor speed.

Hello,\\n\\nI received my Netgate 2100 with PFSense + today after coming from a Watchguard Firebox and I have been attempting to setup individual network interfaces for VLANS within my home environment. I saw this was possible in the Switch Overview section of the manual ([https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/solutions/netgate-2100/switch-overview.html](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/solutions/netgate-2100/switch-overview.html)).  I have attached pictures of my configuration settings for different areas and I have been trying to set LAN 1 & 4 as part of my regular home network LAN, LAN 2 as VLAN 2, & LAN ID 3 as VLAN ID 3. Unfortunately, with my current settings I am not getting an IP Address when connecting a computer to LAN 2 & 3. I have already setup the DHCP server (mirroring the default LAN 1 settings, except for ipv6) and tried setting statically on the computer with no luck getting network access. I have internet access from LAN 1 currently. I have enabled 802.1q VLAN Mode for this configuration above. I also had copied firewall rules from the default LAN to both VLANs checking the box for convert interface definitions (just for testing purposes for now).\\n\\nNote: I did not take pictures of all the settings in each page, I only took pictures of fields I have modified.\\n\\nAny recommendations on how to get DHCP/internet access working on LAN 2 & 3 (VLAN ID 2 & VLAN ID 3)?\\n\\nI appreciate any assistance that could be provided. I feel like I am missing something simple within the settings but I am not that familiar with PFSense and some of the terminologies used during setup. I watched a few videos relating to setting up VLANs, but it seems like most were preparing to use a managed switch with VLANs setup on it and not the use-case that I am attempting to setup which is individual network interfaces.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

I've tried Nextcloud and similar and they're great for syncing documents and photos, but I still cannot find a self-hosted app for large file transfers (such as sending and receiving video files or large archival zips and tars).\\n\\nDoes anybody know of any self-hosted apps that would meet the following criteria?:\\n\\n1. Can handle 100GB+ files. Web browser based transfers seem to shit the bed if the filesize is over a few GB.\\n2. Fully saturates network. Nextcloud seems to not be as fast as it could be. It seems like there is a software bottleneck because I can never get it to max out my hardware during a transfer. It's fast enough for documents and photos, but for large file transfers I need the fastest speeds possible otherwise transfers take days rather than hours.\\n3. Simple and fast to set up for other people. I should be able to have a client download a desktop app and simply drag and drop a file or folder and it takes care of the rest. A user login wouldn't be the end of the world, but if something has the ability to simply enter a passphrase that I can pre-arrange per friend or client that would be a bonus.\\n\\nI used a similar program in the past but I believe it was a paid proprietary setup. Something \\\"Shuttle\\\" transfer....don't really remember the name.\\n\\nAny suggestions? I would consider ftp to be just passed the level of complexity in terms of user experience than what I'm looking for.\",\n          \"Need help: world map won't render properly as html file.

I can get   to load correctly and [  as well, but using the mydomain.com by itself goes to the original hosting provider of the domain.

I added a URL redirect rule within the custom domain within the CDN to try and force it to change to   .
