       "387070  When copying files with Dolphin (KDE Plasma's file manager), if there is not enough free space to copy the incoming files entirely, the file manager refuses to copy even a single file. However, a lot of the time I'll be skipping name conflicts or overwriting existing files with new ones, so either I don't need as much space than it seems to the system, or space is freed up as I copy. Also, KDE seems to have trouble accurately determining the free space on drives on a network file server that I have mounted with SSHFS, so it will say there is not enough space even when there is. \\n\\nIs there a way to get Dolphin to ignore this error and attempt to copy the files anyway? Like the way the cp command does it, where it doesn't really care how much space is on the drive, and will only throw an error if it actually fills up before it's done copying. Or better yet, is there a way to get Dolphin to still warn me about potential space issues, but have the option to ignore it and attempt to c...  \n",

For example while playing YouTube videos I set 1440p resolution on my 2k laptop and 2k smartphone despite having a option of selecting 2160p option. So i wanted to ask if i get better video quality if i select 2160p option while playing on a 2k display?  "

I heard Linux has lot of issues with battery life and graphics cards like Nvidia. But I found pop os natively supports Nvidia and has a lot of good features so now I am thinking of installing it in my laptop besides windows but I am little scared about the battery management system as Linux has previous bad records with it so can anyone recommend me if pop os is good os to have no complications with the battery life of my hp laptop.  \n",

Plus I think that Ethernet Gadget is created pretty late, right before the login prompt shows up. While hardware Ethernet adapters just autoconnect and I can telnet/SSH to them.\\n\\nThe USB Ethernet Gadget doesn't. Why do I have to go and manually connect them on every reboot? Anyone have any solutions? Alpine+rc-service, just get that usb0 and usb1 connections connected automatically. nmcli is not respecting the automatically connect option.  \n",

Just a few housekeeping items to kick things off:\\n\\n* I'm 33 years old and have worked in corporate finance for the last 10 years.\\n* I have worked call center, operations, been a team lead, and ultimately a manager for several years now.\\n* Computers and IT have been something that I've been heavily interested in as a hobby since I was 15 or 16 years old.\\n* I studied for 50-55 total hours over the course of the last two weeks and tested this morning.\\n\\nWith the above having been covered, I am absolutely amazed at what I didn't know (and also now have a curiosity for what I *still don't know* - seems infinite) after having studied for the 1101 in and of itself. There are so many cool things that I've only needed in passing...   \n",

Hi, I would like to ask about differences between working in a company that makes proprietary software vs company that makes open source software. I am interested to know about differences in metodologies, processes or culture, not if one pays more than other. Or why it would be important for \"open source\" company to look for someone who already has open source experience.   \n",
       "2     [OpenCV, Windows] Reading frames from a specific window - PS Remote Play gives black screen. I'm trying to capture gameplay from my PlayStation 5 into OpenCV. Using PS Remote Play, I'm able to view the live feed on my PC as a window. I then tried to read frames from this window in OpenCV, but the frame is black: [Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/3JPHoEt)\\n\\nI am using code sourced from [here](https://github.com/learncodebygaming/opencv_tutorials/tree/master/005_real_time): just using the files `main.py` and `windowcapture.py` with the window name 'PS Remote Play'. The window does not need to be actually visible on screen, although it does need to be non-minimised.\\n\\nI tried viewing other windows and had mixed results: Remote Play and Microsoft To Do show black screens, Microsoft Whiteboard shows a white screen (and it's not the board), while Spotify does actually work.

I have a 550 w psu and would like to buy a 2060 it says that it is the minimum requirement for a 2060 and I'm worried that as its the minimum it wouldn't work to good and just want to know if I'm overtaking or what because I could go with a lower gpu but not if I don't have to so just looking for opinions from more educated people so just let me know what you think I should do   \n",
