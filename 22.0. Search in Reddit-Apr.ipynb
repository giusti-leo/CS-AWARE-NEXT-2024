       "387070  When copying files with Dolphin (KDE Plasma's file manager), if there is not enough free space to copy the incoming files entirely, the file manager refuses to copy even a single file. However, a lot of the time I'll be skipping name conflicts or overwriting existing files with new ones, so either I don't need as much space than it seems to the system, or space is freed up as I copy. Also, KDE seems to have trouble accurately determining the free space on drives on a network file server that I have mounted with SSHFS, so it will say there is not enough space even when there is. \\n\\nIs there a way to get Dolphin to ignore this error and attempt to copy the files anyway? Like the way the cp command does it, where it doesn't really care how much space is on the drive, and will only throw an error if it actually fills up before it's done copying. Or better yet, is there a way to get Dolphin to still warn me about potential space issues, but have the option to ignore it and attempt to c...  \n",

For example while playing YouTube videos I set 1440p resolution on my 2k laptop and 2k smartphone despite having a option of selecting 2160p option. So i wanted to ask if i get better video quality if i select 2160p option while playing on a 2k display?  "

I just got a crash report saying \"Gnome Shell  crashed with sigsegv\". I did upload the crash report, but I don't know  how to track it. I went through the crash report, and the stack trace  contains a similar pattern:\\n\\n    Thread 26 (LWP 2915):  #0  0x00007f69a5e91197 in ?? ()  No symbol table info available.  Backtrace stopped: Cannot access memory at address 0x7f69667ffd90 \\n\\nThis is a common  pattern, with different threads and memory addresses. Is this a known  GNOME bug, or is it specific to my system? Is there a way to check if the system files are corrupt? Since this is my daily driver, I cannot afford to have a corrupt system whatsoever. If that means I have to reinstall the OS from scratch, I am ready to do so.  \\n\\n\\nEdit:  \\nSystem specs:  \\nAMD Ryzen 1700   \\nAsus Strix RX 6600 XT  \\nNothing is overclock...</td>\n",

The targets are in scope of the H1 programs from these companies. Does anyone have a recommendation/preference for a provider that is more tolerant? I was considering DO and I'm a bit worried about running this on my local machine. FYI just to be clear, these are all within scope of the H1 programs, I just think their net admins might be reporting my scan activity as a false positive.  \n",

       "30218  I  am using Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS. It was installed on 26th March, so it's a  relatively recent install. I am using GNOME as-is, and have not  installed any extensions. I just got a crash report saying \"Gnome Shell  crashed with sigsegv\". I did upload the crash report, but I don't know  how to track it. I went through the crash report, and the stack trace  contains a similar pattern:\\n\\n    Thread 26 (LWP 2915):  #0  0x00007f69a5e91197 in ?? ()  No symbol table info available.  Backtrace stopped: Cannot access memory at address 0x7f69667ffd90 \\n\\nThis is a common  pattern, with different threads and memory addresses. Is this a known  GNOME bug, or is it specific to my system? Is there a way to check if the system files are corrupt? Since this is my daily driver, I cannot afford to have a corrupt system whatsoever. If that means I have to reinstall the OS from scratch, I am ready to do so.  \\n\\n\\nEdit:  \\nSystem specs:  \\nAMD Ryzen 1700   \\nAsus Strix RX 6600 XT  \\nNothing is overclock...  \n",

Started writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks. Eventually I managed to redirect my hobby Linux skills into a productive career at several different companies working on the typical array of DevOps-related things: CI/CD, infrastructure as code, monitoring, release management, containerization, orchestration, architecture.

I'm from the company's business side, and I have a tech background but no prior ISM experience. They don't consider hiring a consultant at this point. \\n\\nIn the first place, I looked for ISO 27001 paid templates with implementation guidance, but it appears to be a time-consuming process to obtain the certificate.

The targets are in scope of the H1 programs from these companies. Does anyone have a recommendation/preference for a provider that is more tolerant? I was considering DO and I'm a bit worried about running this on my local machine. FYI just to be clear, these are all within scope of the H1 programs, I just think their net admins might be reporting my scan activity as a false positive.  \n",
