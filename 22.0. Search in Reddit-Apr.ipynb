       "387070  When copying files with Dolphin (KDE Plasma's file manager), if there is not enough free space to copy the incoming files entirely, the file manager refuses to copy even a single file. However, a lot of the time I'll be skipping name conflicts or overwriting existing files with new ones, so either I don't need as much space than it seems to the system, or space is freed up as I copy. Also, KDE seems to have trouble accurately determining the free space on drives on a network file server that I have mounted with SSHFS, so it will say there is not enough space even when there is. \\n\\nIs there a way to get Dolphin to ignore this error and attempt to copy the files anyway? Like the way the cp command does it, where it doesn't really care how much space is on the drive, and will only throw an error if it actually fills up before it's done copying. Or better yet, is there a way to get Dolphin to still warn me about potential space issues, but have the option to ignore it and attempt to c...  \n",

For example while playing YouTube videos I set 1440p resolution on my 2k laptop and 2k smartphone despite having a option of selecting 2160p option. So i wanted to ask if i get better video quality if i select 2160p option while playing on a 2k display?  "

I just got a crash report saying \"Gnome Shell  crashed with sigsegv\". I did upload the crash report, but I don't know  how to track it. I went through the crash report, and the stack trace  contains a similar pattern:\\n\\n    Thread 26 (LWP 2915):  #0  0x00007f69a5e91197 in ?? ()  No symbol table info available.  Backtrace stopped: Cannot access memory at address 0x7f69667ffd90 \\n\\nThis is a common  pattern, with different threads and memory addresses. Is this a known  GNOME bug, or is it specific to my system? Is there a way to check if the system files are corrupt? Since this is my daily driver, I cannot afford to have a corrupt system whatsoever. If that means I have to reinstall the OS from scratch, I am ready to do so.  \\n\\n\\nEdit:  \\nSystem specs:  \\nAMD Ryzen 1700   \\nAsus Strix RX 6600 XT  \\nNothing is overclock...</td>\n",

The targets are in scope of the H1 programs from these companies. Does anyone have a recommendation/preference for a provider that is more tolerant? I was considering DO and I'm a bit worried about running this on my local machine. FYI just to be clear, these are all within scope of the H1 programs, I just think their net admins might be reporting my scan activity as a false positive.  \n",

       "30218  I  am using Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS. It was installed on 26th March, so it's a  relatively recent install. I am using GNOME as-is, and have not  installed any extensions. I just got a crash report saying \"Gnome Shell  crashed with sigsegv\". I did upload the crash report, but I don't know  how to track it. I went through the crash report, and the stack trace  contains a similar pattern:\\n\\n    Thread 26 (LWP 2915):  #0  0x00007f69a5e91197 in ?? ()  No symbol table info available.  Backtrace stopped: Cannot access memory at address 0x7f69667ffd90 \\n\\nThis is a common  pattern, with different threads and memory addresses. Is this a known  GNOME bug, or is it specific to my system? Is there a way to check if the system files are corrupt? Since this is my daily driver, I cannot afford to have a corrupt system whatsoever. If that means I have to reinstall the OS from scratch, I am ready to do so.  \\n\\n\\nEdit:  \\nSystem specs:  \\nAMD Ryzen 1700   \\nAsus Strix RX 6600 XT  \\nNothing is overclock...  \n",

Started writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks. Eventually I managed to redirect my hobby Linux skills into a productive career at several different companies working on the typical array of DevOps-related things: CI/CD, infrastructure as code, monitoring, release management, containerization, orchestration, architecture.

I'm from the company's business side, and I have a tech background but no prior ISM experience. They don't consider hiring a consultant at this point. \\n\\nIn the first place, I looked for ISO 27001 paid templates with implementation guidance, but it appears to be a time-consuming process to obtain the certificate.

The targets are in scope of the H1 programs from these companies. Does anyone have a recommendation/preference for a provider that is more tolerant? I was considering DO and I'm a bit worried about running this on my local machine. FYI just to be clear, these are all within scope of the H1 programs, I just think their net admins might be reporting my scan activity as a false positive.  \n",

The script generates an API token using login credentials and uses that token to access the API for retrieving data.  I'm able to successfully retrieve data from the API and created the tables in PostgreSQL with my script, however, the data is not being inserted into the PostgreSQL database. I've added printouts for potential errors that may be occurring with the insert process but nothing is showing. I hope someone can point me in the right direction.

I opened an attachment from an email. It wasn't trying to make it super urgent and the email was from my boss, so it was a trusted person. I clicked the link and it asked me to sign in to my account. I made sure that I had 2FA so encase it was malicious, my email couldnt be logged into. I put in my email and password and it says \"something went wrong\" and kicked me off the page (obviously not legit). I ran both Bitdefender and TotalAV and they said that I was all clear, and my Gmail shows no updates, not even an attempted log in. I just wanted to check here to ask: is there anything more I should do to ensure my data hasn't been compromised?   \n",
       "1  Secure by Default - 365 nightmare. Over the past few weeks we have noticed odd behaviour with MS more specifically EXO. Our latest complaint is safe emails are now all of the sudden going into quarantine. We are a mortgage company and our users do business with many 3rd parties. Emails were flowing with out issue up until recently. Communication between our users and external 3parties starts out as it should, then for some reason the detection methods go crazy and quarantines the emails. Its becoming a headache to monitor the quarantine, release and report/submit false positives to MS. In the past 30 days we have submitted over 500 emails as false positives. On the MS doc for Secure by Default, it states that this cannot be turned off by admins. And the percentage rate is low for false positives. I dis believe this as we are seeing a high impact.  I have done some tweaking by adding these domains to safe senders list but this has little resolve as some of the messages are marked as...   \n",

Apologies if this is the wrong sub for this question. I'm on a mission to try and organize the large amount of files/documents/images I need for my business and cut down on the number of emails with attachments I send out daily. I've considered just paying for a cloud based file share service but I'm wondering if there is a home based alternative that someone with not a ton a IT experience could manage. \\n\\nMy requirements are as follows. 1: Home based solution. 2: Easy to manage. 3: Able to be accessed remotely by multiple authorized users. 4: \\~10TB of storage. 5: Not horribly expensive. \\n\\nMaybe at the end of the day I would just be better off paying for a could based service but I want to see what options are available.   \n",
