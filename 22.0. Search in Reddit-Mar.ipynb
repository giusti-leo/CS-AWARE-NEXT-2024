       "387070  When copying files with Dolphin (KDE Plasma's file manager), if there is not enough free space to copy the incoming files entirely, the file manager refuses to copy even a single file. However, a lot of the time I'll be skipping name conflicts or overwriting existing files with new ones, so either I don't need as much space than it seems to the system, or space is freed up as I copy. Also, KDE seems to have trouble accurately determining the free space on drives on a network file server that I have mounted with SSHFS, so it will say there is not enough space even when there is. \\n\\nIs there a way to get Dolphin to ignore this error and attempt to copy the files anyway? Like the way the cp command does it, where it doesn't really care how much space is on the drive, and will only throw an error if it actually fills up before it's done copying. Or better yet, is there a way to get Dolphin to still warn me about potential space issues, but have the option to ignore it and attempt to c...  \n",

For example while playing YouTube videos I set 1440p resolution on my 2k laptop and 2k smartphone despite having a option of selecting 2160p option. So i wanted to ask if i get better video quality if i select 2160p option while playing on a 2k display?  "

I want to bring unique content to my submission by comparing and contrasting specific approaches and then providing insights and original ideas for responding.\\n\\nI came here to see if people would be willing to share playbooks for root access that I could learn from and compare and contrast. Or perhaps people could point me to resources that have multiple examples with lots of detail.\\n\\nThank you in advance,\\n\\nPeter</td>\n",

I don't know how realistic them getting a new number is. Is there a way to use a proxy for them?\\n* For email it's the same issue. Their email is compromised and gets  regular influx of spam assault. The filter seems to work 99% of the time  but...I'd rather them have a clean email.  \n",

       "4      Hello. This is my first post in this group. I have observed that that you are all very generous with your knowledge, time and experience. Thank you. I hope to make valuable contributions in the future.\\n\\nI'm taking some entry level Cybersecurity courses. The task for this week is create a playbook to respond to an incident. I'm going to choose \"root access\" because it's seems less mundane than Malware or DDOS, etc.\\n\\nThere are playbook templates in the public domain that seem useful for getting organized but lack detail on specific actions. I want to bring unique content to my submission by comparing and contrasting specific approaches and then providing insights and original ideas for responding.\\n\\nI came here to see if people would be willing to share playbooks for root access that I could learn from and compare and contrast. Or perhaps people could point me to resources that have multiple examples with lots of detail.\\n\\nThank you in advance,\\n\\nPeter  \n",

I choose WhatsApp and it asks me which one.\\n\\nSo my question is: do you know if there's a way to direct to the main app when sharing/doing a shortcut directly, instead of asking which one?\\n\\nThank you in advance!  \n",
