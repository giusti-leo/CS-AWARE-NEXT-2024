I've tried Nextcloud and similar and they're great for syncing documents and photos, but I still cannot find a self-hosted app for large file transfers (such as sending and receiving video files or large archival zips and tars).\\n\\nDoes anybody know of any self-hosted apps that would meet the following criteria?:\\n\\n1. Can handle 100GB+ files. Web browser based transfers seem to shit the bed if the filesize is over a few GB.\\n2. Fully saturates network. Nextcloud seems to not be as fast as it could be. It seems like there is a software bottleneck because I can never get it to max out my hardware during a transfer. It's fast enough for documents and photos, but for large file transfers I need the fastest speeds possible otherwise transfers take days rather than hours.\\n3. Simple and fast to set up for other people. I should be able to have a client download a desktop app and simply drag and drop a file or folder and it takes care of the rest. A user login wouldn't be the end of the world, but if something has the ability to simply enter a passphrase that I can pre-arrange per friend or client that would be a bonus.\\n\\nI used a similar program in the past but I believe it was a paid proprietary setup. Something \\\"Shuttle\\\" transfer....don't really remember the name.\\n\\nAny suggestions? I would consider ftp to be just passed the level of complexity in terms of user experience than what I'm looking for.\",\n          \"Need help: world map won't render properly as html file.

Does anyone know how to get a naked domain working properly in Azure? I can get   to load correctly and [  as well, but using the mydomain.com by itself goes to the original hosting provider of the domain. This is just for a static website as part of the cloud resume challenge. I have a CDN setup and a CNAME added to my domain. I have my custom domain added to the CDN and have HTTPS enabled where it pulled a cert from Azure. I added a URL redirect rule within the custom domain within the CDN to try and force it to change to   .  I even tried adding an A record to point my domain to the IPv4 address of my CDN endpoint, but still no luck. This challenge has been tough but fun so far - a lot of new concepts for me.

I've tried Nextcloud and similar and they're great for syncing documents and photos, but I still cannot find a self-hosted app for large file transfers (such as sending and receiving video files or large archival zips and tars).\\n\\nDoes anybody know of any self-hosted apps that would meet the following criteria?:\\n\\n1. Can handle 100GB+ files. Web browser based transfers seem to shit the bed if the filesize is over a few GB.\\n2. Fully saturates network. Nextcloud seems to not be as fast as it could be. It seems like there is a software bottleneck because I can never get it to max out my hardware during a transfer. It's fast enough for documents and photos, but for large file transfers I need the fastest speeds possible otherwise transfers take days rather than hours.\\n3. Simple and fast to set up for other people. I should be able to have a client download a desktop app and simply drag and drop a file or folder and it takes care of the rest. A user login wouldn't be the end of the world, but if something has the ability to simply enter a passphrase that I can pre-arrange per friend or client that would be a bonus.\\n\\nI used a similar program in the past but I believe it was a paid proprietary setup. Something \\\"Shuttle\\\" transfer....don't really remember the name.\\n\\nAny suggestions? I would consider ftp to be just passed the level of complexity in terms of user experience than what I'm looking for.\",\n          \"Need help: world map won't render properly as html file.

I added a URL redirect rule within the custom domain within the CDN to try and force it to change to   .

I've tried Nextcloud and similar and they're great for syncing documents and photos, but I still cannot find a self-hosted app for large file transfers (such as sending and receiving video files or large archival zips and tars).\\n\\nDoes anybody know of any self-hosted apps that would meet the following criteria?:\\n\\n1. Can handle 100GB+ files. Web browser based transfers seem to shit the bed if the filesize is over a few GB.\\n2. Fully saturates network. Nextcloud seems to not be as fast as it could be. It seems like there is a software bottleneck because I can never get it to max out my hardware during a transfer. It's fast enough for documents and photos, but for large file transfers I need the fastest speeds possible otherwise transfers take days rather than hours.\\n3. Simple and fast to set up for other people. I should be able to have a client download a desktop app and simply drag and drop a file or folder and it takes care of the rest. A user login wouldn't be the end of the world, but if something has the ability to simply enter a passphrase that I can pre-arrange per friend or client that would be a bonus.\\n\\nI used a similar program in the past but I believe it was a paid proprietary setup. Something \\\"Shuttle\\\" transfer....don't really remember the name.\\n\\nAny suggestions? I would consider ftp to be just passed the level of complexity in terms of user experience than what I'm looking for.\",\n          \"Need help: world map won't render properly as html file.

I added a URL redirect rule within the custom domain within the CDN to try and force it to change to   .

I have since received 4 different emails. Here is the most recent email:\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/1Mmzu3p\\n\\nAt first I was worried that I had been infected by something, but the fact that it was my school email and I only opened emails from my verified instructors is what prompted me to look up if it was legit or not. I found out that it was fake, but because they obviously got in my email to send it to me, I changed my password anyway. I keep getting the emails though. About once a month or so, another one pops up. Are these emails actually coming from my address, or is there a way to spoof an email to make it look like the same email to the point that Gmail thinks it's me? How do I stop them? It's getting really annoying.\\n\\nI have already changed my password to a completely different phrase, but that didn't make a difference. I also checked if there were any scheduled emails waiting to be sent, but there weren't any. The emails weren't even in my sent folder when I tried to verify if they were actually coming from my email.\\nI think that's everything.

I am simply trying to set up a dedicated server for a game (Left 4 Dead 2), I don't know any technical jargon so go easy on me. I have an ASUS RT-AX58U with custom Asuswrt-Merlin firmware installed (version 30004.388.4.0). I've port forwarded and got my server working a couple years ago, but recently trying to run the server results in only my main computer (the one hosting) being able to join. Not even my laptop on the same Wifi can join. I've used port checking sites to see if the ports are open and they say they aren't, even though it's all set up properly.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/shago9pwbhpb1.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=898e0e054fc376e2fe99d9d817e08e33f56e94a4\\n\\nThis is what I have, and to my knowledge, this is all I need to do? The internal IP Address is selected to be my main computer, the one that I will host the server and play the game simultaneously. I don't remember doing any additional steps except going from the home page of the Asus router site, hitting WAN, hitting Virtual Server / Port Forwarding, and adding this profile. I've unplugged and replugged both my modem and router, I've tried falling back to older firmware, nothing has fixed it. What could be the issue here?  I know my modem is kinda old, maybe 4-5 years, could that be the culprit?\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 18111,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"windows 10 download help.

I am simply trying to set up a dedicated server for a game (Left 4 Dead 2), I don't know any technical jargon so go easy on me. I have an ASUS RT-AX58U with custom Asuswrt-Merlin firmware installed (version 30004.388.4.0). I've port forwarded and got my server working a couple years ago, but recently trying to run the server results in only my main computer (the one hosting) being able to join. Not even my laptop on the same Wifi can join. I've used port checking sites to see if the ports are open and they say they aren't, even though it's all set up properly.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/shago9pwbhpb1.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=898e0e054fc376e2fe99d9d817e08e33f56e94a4\\n\\nThis is what I have, and to my knowledge, this is all I need to do? The internal IP Address is selected to be my main computer, the one that I will host the server and play the game simultaneously. I don't remember doing any additional steps except going from the home page of the Asus router site, hitting WAN, hitting Virtual Server / Port Forwarding, and adding this profile. I've unplugged and replugged both my modem and router, I've tried falling back to older firmware, nothing has fixed it. What could be the issue here?  I know my modem is kinda old, maybe 4-5 years, could that be the culprit?\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 18111,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"windows 10 download help.

I have since received 4 different emails. Here is the most recent email:\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/1Mmzu3p\\n\\nAt first I was worried that I had been infected by something, but the fact that it was my school email and I only opened emails from my verified instructors is what prompted me to look up if it was legit or not. I found out that it was fake, but because they obviously got in my email to send it to me, I changed my password anyway. I keep getting the emails though. About once a month or so, another one pops up. Are these emails actually coming from my address, or is there a way to spoof an email to make it look like the same email to the point that Gmail thinks it's me? How do I stop them? It's getting really annoying.\\n\\nI have already changed my password to a completely different phrase, but that didn't make a difference. I also checked if there were any scheduled emails waiting to be sent, but there weren't any. The emails weren't even in my sent folder when I tried to verify if they were actually coming from my email.\\nI think that's everything.

A debate has broken out among the tech wings in my area.

A lot of companies seem to be moving away from it too.   What are your thoughts r/sysadmin?\\n\\nThe side against it is basically saying that after a while users will just be used to seeing it all the time and ignore it. Or even worse just blindly trust any email that comes through without the warning.\\n\\nThey seem to think that we should train the users to be suspicious of every mail whether interal or external.\\n\\n**EDIT:** added what the side against was saying for clarity.

During these calls, an individual claiming to be from Telegram attempted to verify my account. Fortunately, I did not disclose the verification code, as I recognized the scam. Nonetheless, it is evident that they were actively listening, as they eventually discontinued their efforts after I explicitly expressed my refusal to be deceived. What troubles me is their usage of my complete legal name, despite its lack of association with any of my accounts.\\n\\n\\nCamera Hacked Via Telegram (audio ON)\\n\\nIn the second video, a sequence of screenshots inadvertently captured the camera being activated. It was only towards the end that I noticed this occurrence, prompting me to create a screen recording to document the situation. The recording clearly demonstrates that the Telegram app was accessing the camera on my phone, despite my not actively taking any pictures. Interestingly, as soon as I initiate a screen recording, Telegram disconnects, causing the green dot indicating camera usage to disappear.

A debate has broken out among the tech wings in my area. I am turning to Reddit to settle the debate.\\n\\nIs it still considered best practice to have an external email warning on your emails?\\n\\nIn case you have no idea what I'm talking about, I mean a little warning box at the top of an email warning your user that the email has originated from outside of the company, so be cautious clicking any links or opening attachments.\\n\\nAt one time this was widely used and I know some orgs still do.  A lot of companies seem to be moving away from it too.   What are your thoughts r/sysadmin?\\n\\nThe side against it is basically saying that after a while users will just be used to seeing it all the time and ignore it. Or even worse just blindly trust any email that comes through without the warning.\\n\\nThey seem to think that we should train the users to be suspicious of every mail whether interal or external.\\n\\n**EDIT:** added what the side against was saying for clarity.

During these calls, an individual claiming to be from Telegram attempted to verify my account. Fortunately, I did not disclose the verification code, as I recognized the scam. Nonetheless, it is evident that they were actively listening, as they eventually discontinued their efforts after I explicitly expressed my refusal to be deceived. What troubles me is their usage of my complete legal name, despite its lack of association with any of my accounts.\\n\\n\\nCamera Hacked Via Telegram (audio ON)\\n\\nIn the second video, a sequence of screenshots inadvertently captured the camera being activated. It was only towards the end that I noticed this occurrence, prompting me to create a screen recording to document the situation. The recording clearly demonstrates that the Telegram app was accessing the camera on my phone, despite my not actively taking any pictures. Interestingly, as soon as I initiate a screen recording, Telegram disconnects, causing the green dot indicating camera usage to disappear.
