       "387070  When copying files with Dolphin (KDE Plasma's file manager), if there is not enough free space to copy the incoming files entirely, the file manager refuses to copy even a single file. However, a lot of the time I'll be skipping name conflicts or overwriting existing files with new ones, so either I don't need as much space than it seems to the system, or space is freed up as I copy. Also, KDE seems to have trouble accurately determining the free space on drives on a network file server that I have mounted with SSHFS, so it will say there is not enough space even when there is. \\n\\nIs there a way to get Dolphin to ignore this error and attempt to copy the files anyway? Like the way the cp command does it, where it doesn't really care how much space is on the drive, and will only throw an error if it actually fills up before it's done copying. Or better yet, is there a way to get Dolphin to still warn me about potential space issues, but have the option to ignore it and attempt to c...  \n",

For example while playing YouTube videos I set 1440p resolution on my 2k laptop and 2k smartphone despite having a option of selecting 2160p option. So i wanted to ask if i get better video quality if i select 2160p option while playing on a 2k display?  "

Also, KDE seems to have trouble accurately determining the free space on drives on a network file server that I have mounted with SSHFS, so it will say there is not enough space even when there is. \\n\\nIs there a way to get Dolphin to ignore this error and attempt to copy the files anyway? Like the way the cp command does it, where it doesn't really care how much space is on the drive, and will only throw an error if it actually fills up before it's done copying.

Call from and to single contact makes the phone ring here as well as on the other end when we make whatsapp calls. \\n\\nAnother detail is that when I make a call to the group there is no ringing happening on my end while I am waiting for another party to answer.\\nSo, please, can anyone advise how can I asign ringtones to whatsapp groups, if it is possible at all!  Thanks.  \n",

       "34430  When copying files with Dolphin (KDE Plasma's file manager), if there is not enough free space to copy the incoming files entirely, the file manager refuses to copy even a single file. However, a lot of the time I'll be skipping name conflicts or overwriting existing files with new ones, so either I don't need as much space than it seems to the system, or space is freed up as I copy. Also, KDE seems to have trouble accurately determining the free space on drives on a network file server that I have mounted with SSHFS, so it will say there is not enough space even when there is. \\n\\nIs there a way to get Dolphin to ignore this error and attempt to copy the files anyway? Like the way the cp command does it, where it doesn't really care how much space is on the drive, and will only throw an error if it actually fills up before it's done copying. Or better yet, is there a way to get Dolphin to still warn me about potential space issues, but have the option to ignore it and attempt to c...  \n",

Hello All,  \\n\\n\\nI work at an MSP managing various types of networks, I've never run into a Time Sync issue I haven't been able to solve until now.  \\n\\n\\nI've been all over the internet researching various topics but have not found a solution. Here is a summary of the issue and steps taken so far:  \\n\\n\\nIssue:  \\nThe PDC in a domain environment recently fell out of sync by \\~1 minute.

The error received when attempted to re-sync time is \"The computer did not resync because no time data was available\" with all tested time sources. If manually testing against the time sync the error code given is 0x800705B4.\\n\\nSteps Taken:\\n\\n\\-Followed various different articles referencing different potential solutions\\n\\n\\-Removed the GPO to stop the time sync from spreading\\n\\n\\-Ran through the typical net start ...   \n",

I tested my two RAM slots and tried a brand new one. Also my disk are ok. Only thing I am able to do is open the system setup, and everything seems to be ok there.

My question is, can I save the entire system as it is, including games etc, on the OneDrive or do I need to \"backup\" the PC. I am honestly somewhat new to backing up my PC and am oblivious to what that actually means. Basically I want to, if it is at all possible, back up everything including games, the wallpaper that currently sits on my screen, settings, etc.... but I dont know how to do that.

How is this possible? What am I missing here?  \\nWhy isnt police closing these websites and catching everyone behind this software?  \\nIs it enough of them to claim that this is for \"remote operations and control remote computers\" despite these tools having bundled software like keylogger, which is yet another type of malware?   \n",

I plan on designing a RAT (ideally the  meterpreter since i'd like to not reinvent the wheel; but if that truly won't work i take no issue making one of my own), but since Windows  10 and up comes with Defender while stuff like Win7 (which may still be  used) doesn't, I don't know what exactly to do.\\n\\nI  understand scammers are dumb and it's not exactly going to be the same  to a pentest or something, but I'd also like to not underestimate them  since that'd have a high possibility of backfiring.

First post, don't be harsh.\\n\\nContext: teaching myself the basics of penetration testing using a Kali VM and a Windows 7 VM connected via NAT network. \\n\\nLooking to further my penetration testing skills and want to create a permanent backdoor in a windows 7 VM. I already have usernames and passwords for this VM collected using MSFW, reverse\\_tcp session (basically every YT video on hacking Windows 7). I want to either, create this meterpreter session every time the user boots up so I have constant access or find another way to access the vm whenever it is turned on using the credentials. The reverse\\_tcp session (meterpreter) requires the user to run the .exe, hence if the exe could be run upon boot - I would always have a connection...? Do you know where I'm coming from? \\n\\nI'm pretty new to Kali so if there's a way for me to remote connect to the windows VM using the Windows creds that would be ideal as it seems more 'professional'.   \n",
