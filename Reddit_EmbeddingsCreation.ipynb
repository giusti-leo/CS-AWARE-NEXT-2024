Hey folks,\\n\\nI was wondering how one should setup a backup solution for a standard kubernetes cluster, I'm using Hetzner Cloud which offers volumes but is fairly limited, each volume must be at least 10G large and and there is no integrated backup. So I tried longhorn which has a really neat backup/snapshot solution, the only down side is that the installation is fairly complex because it only works with locally mounted volumes, but not with existing storageclasses like rook does. \\n\\nSo my next try was rook, setup was really smooth because it just uses the existing storageclass from hetzner. However, rook doesn't include a backup solution so I searched a bit and was really disappointed, which is the reason why I'm writing this post. \\n\\nThe only \\\"real\\\" backup solutions I could find was Kasten, Stash and Velero. By real I mean, has a somewhat reputable company behind it, not a hobby project on github that hasn't been updated in years. Kasten is of the table because it's only free for up to 5 nodes. Stash works kind of but is cumbersome to setup because you need to create a bunch of crds for every workload you deploy. Velero only worked for the manifests, but I could t get it to backup actual pvcs. \\n\\nI understand that backing up pvcs was hard a few years ago, because you had to use rwx volumes or inject a sidecar into the pods to read the data. But we have CSI and VolumeSnapshots now, so shouldn't it be easy to just periodically create snapshots and mount those into a restic container which saves the data to s3? Is it really that simple and just nobody has done it or am I missing something here? I have the feeling that there are mainly two kinds of people: the professionals that have the money for completely managed solutions, and the hobbyist that don't care about backups.

(Unfortunately only Windows 11 will have good support for that initially. The Anandtech article linked below mentions that Linux won't have good support for it initially; Intel hasn't finished working on Linux patches to send upstream. So we might have naive thread scheduling on Alder Lake Linux systems for a while\\n\\nSince that was over two years ago, I'm curious to know if Linux is now able to leverage Intel Thread Director, or otherwise utilize P- and E-cores differentially to maximize both performance and efficiency similar to Windows.\",\n          \"Issue with Acer Aspire 3, broken registry items and who knows what else..

So I have my home network setup like shown below. I have my Main Router connected to my ISP. I have a shop about 200' away I needed Wifi in so I did the setup below. I bought a KuWfi Bridge from amazon, and reconfigured them so they would match my network (192.168.1.x). I bought a used router, same model as my Home Router (Linksys MR8300) and configured it to 'Bridge Mode' and deployed to the shop. I have good connectivity to the internet this way, but my problem is that I cant see what devices are connected to the shop router (Linksys interface in 'Bridge Mode' blocks advanced features). I can see what all is connected to the main router, but nothing is showing up that is connected to the shop router, i thought bridge mode was supposed to make them all show up together? Any help or ideas would be great..\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vxct48ogdzb1.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dadf7d981c8675c7384bfb5c576c8c2d25a272d4\",\n          \"Old laptop as a dedicated media streaming pc. Hello! I have an older laptop, around 2015 and id like to dedicate it specifically to content streaming. Im planning on putting it in my familys living room, and letting my entire family use it. Its an amd dualcore apu with 16gbs of ram. I was just going to put it behind the tv and link it with an hdmi cable.\\n\\nThe only issue is, I don't have the money for a vpn at the moment, so downloading media is out of the question, although eventually its going to be a jellyfin server. I also have kids in the house, and as much as I'd like to just like to throw on a web browser and tell them to ignore the nsfw ads, that wont fly either. \\n\\nWhat I was wondering is if there was preferably an OS I could run that is dedicated to scraping websites, (which I understand there probably isnt, but worth the ask) or a linux application I could run on a bare bones install specifically for scraping videos, something like aniyomi without the anime focus. Im just trying to save my family from getting a firestick or android tv box.\\n\\nOr, if its at all possible, running pihole along with a web browser so I can avoid these poor innocent eyes from seeing NSFW ads. This will be my first project like this, and I know pretty much nothing, but totally willing to learn anything. Any ideas or input would be very appreciated, thanks!\",\n          \"Tenda Wireless Adapter giving poor speed.

So I have my home network setup like shown below. I have my Main Router connected to my ISP. I have a shop about 200' away I needed Wifi in so I did the setup below. I bought a KuWfi Bridge from amazon, and reconfigured them so they would match my network (192.168.1.x). I bought a used router, same model as my Home Router (Linksys MR8300) and configured it to 'Bridge Mode' and deployed to the shop. I have good connectivity to the internet this way, but my problem is that I cant see what devices are connected to the shop router (Linksys interface in 'Bridge Mode' blocks advanced features). I can see what all is connected to the main router, but nothing is showing up that is connected to the shop router, i thought bridge mode was supposed to make them all show up together?

Hello! I have an older laptop, around 2015 and id like to dedicate it specifically to content streaming. Im planning on putting it in my familys living room, and letting my entire family use it. Its an amd dualcore apu with 16gbs of ram. I was just going to put it behind the tv and link it with an hdmi cable.\\n\\nThe only issue is, I don't have the money for a vpn at the moment, so downloading media is out of the question, although eventually its going to be a jellyfin server. I also have kids in the house, and as much as I'd like to just like to throw on a web browser and tell them to ignore the nsfw ads, that wont fly either. \\n\\nWhat I was wondering is if there was preferably an OS I could run that is dedicated to scraping websites, (which I understand there probably isnt, but worth the ask) or a linux application I could run on a bare bones install specifically for scraping videos, something like aniyomi without the anime focus. Im just trying to save my family from getting a firestick or android tv box.\\n\\nOr, if its at all possible, running pihole along with a web browser so I can avoid these poor innocent eyes from seeing NSFW ads. This will be my first project like this, and I know pretty much nothing, but totally willing to learn anything. Any ideas or input would be very appreciated, thanks!\",\n          \"Tenda Wireless Adapter giving poor speed.

Hi all, I'd like to say I'm new to this subreddit, though I wanna ask for help. \\n\\nI was trying to find a way to download a DMC game onto my laptop from steamunlocked, I found one that I thought was fine but I clicked on a download link that downloaded malware onto my pc. \\nThinking that it was the file (it was not) it opened up and nothing happened. It wasn't until a bit later when I saw a program called \\\"PC accelerate\\\" running, which was when I realized my mistake. \\n\\nI watched a YouTube tutorial on how to delete the file and ended up uninstalling it, the last step of the video said to restart my pc and I did. As I restarted it, I opened my pc and ended up with it freezing during the start up. (I'm thinking about disabling the starting up apps like Discord and Spotify if I'm able to)\\n\\nAnyway, I just wanna ask for help because I'm kind of panicking. I don't want my pc to end up dying on me because I acted like an idiot and it's willing to kill itself over a startup. \\nHow can I counteract it freezing over? And any of you think that this could be because of the malware? I'd like to know.\",\n          \"Just got this, what do you think, legit?.

I have a Netgear GS728TPPv2 that I added to the Insight Cloud Portal. We are currently building a new network in our building while keeping the old network setup active. I put the ISP line into a dummy switch that had a line going to the old network setup to keep the building tenants live and a line to the new setup so I can work on configuring the new network switches. I was working on adding vlans to the ports so that some only had the external traffic straight from the ISP and some ports only had network traffic for an internal trusted network that comes from a watchguard firewall. Everything was working great until I made port 1 (where the isp comes into the switch) a tagged port with the external vlan (999) and management vlan (1). The moment I did that, the switch lost connection to the cloud AND it \\\"broke\\\" the internet for all tenants on the old network set up. See the attached network diagram for more details. Now I wiped the GS728TPPv2 and removed it from the cloud. Even from factory default settings, the moment I connect the GS728TPPv2 to the dummy switch, it breaks the internet for the users on the old network. How do I fix this loop/routing issue? I have a detailed Network diagram but it wont let me attach the pdf.
