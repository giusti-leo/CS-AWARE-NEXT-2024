I did not even know it existed.\\n\\nToday, I received an email from my boss asking why an ex-employee still had access to the data in such a web platform, as their account hadn't been deactivated. Needless to say, I don't have access to revoke their account or anything.\\n\\nHow can I prevent them from registering on another unauthorized webpage?\\n\\nI feel like a firewall blacklist would be useless since I would have to be constantly researching and updating it with new tools, and I can't make a whitelist since my company uses a ton of different pages for intense web research.\\n\\nAny help or advice would be appreciated.\\n\\n&#x200B;  \n",

For example while playing YouTube videos I set 1440p resolution on my 2k laptop and 2k smartphone despite having a option of selecting 2160p option. So i wanted to ask if i get better video quality if i select 2160p option while playing on a 2k display?  \n",

       "387070  When copying files with Dolphin (KDE Plasma's file manager), if there is not enough free space to copy the incoming files entirely, the file manager refuses to copy even a single file. However, a lot of the time I'll be skipping name conflicts or overwriting existing files with new ones, so either I don't need as much space than it seems to the system, or space is freed up as I copy. Also, KDE seems to have trouble accurately determining the free space on drives on a network file server that I have mounted with SSHFS, so it will say there is not enough space even when there is. \\n\\nIs there a way to get Dolphin to ignore this error and attempt to copy the files anyway? Like the way the cp command does it, where it doesn't really care how much space is on the drive, and will only throw an error if it actually fills up before it's done copying.

       "387070  When copying files with Dolphin (KDE Plasma's file manager), if there is not enough free space to copy the incoming files entirely, the file manager refuses to copy even a single file. However, a lot of the time I'll be skipping name conflicts or overwriting existing files with new ones, so either I don't need as much space than it seems to the system, or space is freed up as I copy. Also, KDE seems to have trouble accurately determining the free space on drives on a network file server that I have mounted with SSHFS, so it will say there is not enough space even when there is. \\n\\nIs there a way to get Dolphin to ignore this error and attempt to copy the files anyway? Like the way the cp command does it, where it doesn't really care how much space is on the drive, and will only throw an error if it actually fills up before it's done copying. Or better yet, is there a way to get Dolphin to still warn me about potential space issues, but have the option to ignore it and attempt to c...  \n",

I consider myself semi tech savvy too. So I've used ventoy to create a bookable drive. And I put the windows 11 iso files on it. But when I try to boot it to windows it says \"upgrade\" and like \"advanced\" and neither option actually let's me install windows. I've been watching video and googling online for like 4 hours on how to and they talk about removing partitions and such after making a dual boot.

And a freind said he could fix it and when he gave it back its ubuntu Linux and I've been using it for months but now I have alot of technical things on my computer I have to do but most the softwares arnt compatible and it's just a bitch to use. I consider myself semi tech savvy too. So I've used ventoy to create a bookable drive. And I put the windows 11 iso files on it. But when I try to boot it to windows it says \"upgrade\" and like \"advanced\" and neither option actually let's me install windows. I've been watching video and googling online for like 4 hours on how to and they talk about removing partitions and such after making a dual boot. Do I really have to do all this and if so whats the simplest way? I just want to use windows not Linux I don't care if all my files get wiped I allready made backups  \n",
