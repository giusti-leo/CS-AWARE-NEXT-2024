       "387070  When copying files with Dolphin (KDE Plasma's file manager), if there is not enough free space to copy the incoming files entirely, the file manager refuses to copy even a single file. However, a lot of the time I'll be skipping name conflicts or overwriting existing files with new ones, so either I don't need as much space than it seems to the system, or space is freed up as I copy. Also, KDE seems to have trouble accurately determining the free space on drives on a network file server that I have mounted with SSHFS, so it will say there is not enough space even when there is. \\n\\nIs there a way to get Dolphin to ignore this error and attempt to copy the files anyway? Like the way the cp command does it, where it doesn't really care how much space is on the drive, and will only throw an error if it actually fills up before it's done copying. Or better yet, is there a way to get Dolphin to still warn me about potential space issues, but have the option to ignore it and attempt to c...  \n",

For example while playing YouTube videos I set 1440p resolution on my 2k laptop and 2k smartphone despite having a option of selecting 2160p option. So i wanted to ask if i get better video quality if i select 2160p option while playing on a 2k display?  "

       "      <td>Hey, i am trying to build a data pipeline where data is extracted from an excel file (highly edited and used by other users) read using pandas dataframe converted into json and inserted whole row of excel as a json clob in the table. The table json values are then called and merge procedure puts data into the required tables with respective columns and that final table is used in our application for our metric. The issue is excel file is constantly changing weekly and metrics in app is being affected.\\n\\nAny idea how to solve this?\\n\\nOr any standard process is there for using excel file data into oracle data table for app UI?</td>\n",

While she was on the subway, her location moved back to her street.\\n\\n\\nCan hackers spoof location and put it in her general home location? Should we be worried about someone on her street potentially being the hacker.\\n\\n\\nThe link sent is too obscure to be her sister playing a joke on her and her sister is also scared of it so it's not her.</td>\n",

The table json values are then called and merge procedure puts data into the required tables with respective columns and that final table is used in our application for our metric. The issue is excel file is constantly changing weekly and metrics in app is being affected.\\n\\nAny idea how to solve this?\\n\\nOr any standard process is there for using excel file data into oracle data table for app UI?  \n",

I assume it was a scam link.\\n\\n\\nBut her Snapchat location while she was hacked was on her home street. She was on the subway for about 15 mins and the entire hack and links took place in these 15 minutes.\\n\\n\\nMe and her sister are the only people who can see her location on Snapchat. While she was on the subway, her location moved back to her street.\\n\\n\\nCan hackers spoof location and put it in her general home location? Should we be worried about someone on her street potentially being the hacker.\\n\\n\\nThe link sent is too obscure to be her sister playing a joke on her and her sister is also scared of it so it's not her.  \n",

However they couldn't be formatted because they couldn't be detected.\\n\\nDoes this sound like the USB sticks were too old? Corrupted etc?
