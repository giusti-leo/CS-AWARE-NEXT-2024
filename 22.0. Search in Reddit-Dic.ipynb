       "387070  When copying files with Dolphin (KDE Plasma's file manager), if there is not enough free space to copy the incoming files entirely, the file manager refuses to copy even a single file. However, a lot of the time I'll be skipping name conflicts or overwriting existing files with new ones, so either I don't need as much space than it seems to the system, or space is freed up as I copy. Also, KDE seems to have trouble accurately determining the free space on drives on a network file server that I have mounted with SSHFS, so it will say there is not enough space even when there is. \\n\\nIs there a way to get Dolphin to ignore this error and attempt to copy the files anyway? Like the way the cp command does it, where it doesn't really care how much space is on the drive, and will only throw an error if it actually fills up before it's done copying. Or better yet, is there a way to get Dolphin to still warn me about potential space issues, but have the option to ignore it and attempt to c...  \n",

For example while playing YouTube videos I set 1440p resolution on my 2k laptop and 2k smartphone despite having a option of selecting 2160p option. So i wanted to ask if i get better video quality if i select 2160p option while playing on a 2k display?  "

GDAP for Microsoft is too feature limiting for our client base on the agility we need and we put security in place to CYA on this but, also is just MS using this partner portal. We have many vendors we want to employ this for. We are looking to avoid if a privileged or tenured tech leaves, we have to change the 'it' privileged account for each client so they don't have these when outside of the company.\\n\\nMy theory is that is would be great to supply the techs access to all passwords, but they can autofill with the password obfuscated. The tech wouldn't need to SEE the password, just fill it via the program. This way they can have access to everything and upon departure, have nothing they could take with them.\\n\\nIs this a product that exists that does that?...</td>\n",

To up til now I've had way better results when it comes to developing websites and web applications compared to being an employee: better performance, speed, accessibility, less bugs, etc. I'm just more productive doing freelancing. And normally, being happy makes a human more productive. Compared to being an employee, I feel like I am doing true craftsmanship: building apps for my clients from zero to the last feature. And later on extending them even more. And I am not only talking about making simple websites with WordPress. Some of my mid-large sized projects are custom made with code like Next.js and Laravel.

       "0      Lots of posts on password managers (currently use Bitwarden), but I am failing to find the solution for password management obfuscation for techs.\\n\\nThe Problem: All techs need access to 'crown jewel' passwords for our techs. GDAP for Microsoft is too feature limiting for our client base on the agility we need and we put security in place to CYA on this but, also is just MS using this partner portal. We have many vendors we want to employ this for. We are looking to avoid if a privileged or tenured tech leaves, we have to change the 'it' privileged account for each client so they don't have these when outside of the company.\\n\\nMy theory is that is would be great to supply the techs access to all passwords, but they can autofill with the password obfuscated. The tech wouldn't need to SEE the password, just fill it via the program. This way they can have access to everything and upon departure, have nothing they could take with them.\\n\\nIs this a product that exists that does that?...  \n",

       "3      Hello everyone\\n\\nSo about a year ago, I wanted to make a transition from being a full-time employee to being a freelancer. First I've created many social media accounts, spread my business word-by-mouth and developed my own [website](https://webdevamin.com). I have to say that I am really happy I've took the step. To up til now I've had way better results when it comes to developing websites and web applications compared to being an employee: better performance, speed, accessibility, less bugs, etc. I'm just more productive doing freelancing. And normally, being happy makes a human more productive. Compared to being an employee, I feel like I am doing true craftsmanship: building apps for my clients from zero to the last feature. And later on extending them even more. And I am not only talking about making simple websites with WordPress. Some of my mid-large sized projects are custom made with code like Next.js and Laravel.

I have also tried purposely entering an incorrect password, and then it comes back with \"Login incorrect\", so more indication that this is not a password issue.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI've confirmed that \"console\" as well as \"tty1\" through \"tty11\" are in /etc/securetty along with the other usuals. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAny ideas of where to look next? This server occasionally loses its network connection and troubleshooting is impossible without being able to get in on the console.  \n",

Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible in 4 cards. Thus, you have to choose 2 cards to discard into the 'crib' prior to the start of the hand. Currently, the class takes in a dealt 6-card hand and returns the highest scoring 4-card combination available. Once each player has tossed 2 cards to the crib, a card is flipped from the deck which acts as a fifth card, available for scoring, to both of the players. The crib, mentioned earlier, is awarded to the dealer of each hand. The dealer scores the crib and adds the awarded points to their hands total. So when the player deals, they are scoring 2 separate 4-card hands. So there is some strategy in what cards you throw into the crib.

       "12  GPU problem. Hello everyone.  \\n\\n\\nFirst off - I have minimal/none knowledge in Linux.\\n\\nI'll try to be short:\\n\\nFirst I had RX 550 GPU installed in my PC which I use solely for Batocera. Things were fine.  \\nThen, I wanted to connect PC to CRT TV and found a script online that automates the process but I had to get an older card, which I did.  \\n\\n\\nI got an HD 3850 and when I swapped cards I had this weird glitch on startup splash screen but when I entered main menu everything was fine so I brushed it off.\\n\\nWhen I booted up a PSX game I was also greeted with graphical glitches (see pictures please) which I had none with previous card.\\n\\nThe HD 3850 is not faulty because I also tested it on Windows and is working fine.  \\n\\n\\nAlso I have to mention that when I launch GPARTED Live USB with 3850 I get super low resolution with things half visible, but when I launch it with RX 550 the resolution is normal.  \\n\\n\\n  \\nSo this makes me think Linux doesn't like my older GPU?  \\n\\n...   \n",

We just got invoiced for over $2,200 a month, when we were paying $550 - and without a contract renewal email or call or anything. We even got ACH debited and now we're trying to get this resolved and hitting nothing but dead ends.

This is disgraceful. For a $550 USD SSD, the power lead is fully broken off, and the pins are bent to shit. The piece was not broken off in box, this had to have happened at the factory. Fix your shitty QA Samsung.. This isn't minor damage, it looked like it was drop kicked across the factory floor.   \n",

GDAP for Microsoft is too feature limiting for our client base on the agility we need and we put security in place to CYA on this but, also is just MS using this partner portal. We have many vendors we want to employ this for. We are looking to avoid if a privileged or tenured tech leaves, we have to change the 'it' privileged account for each client so they don't have these when outside of the company.\\n\\nMy theory is that is would be great to supply the techs access to all passwords, but they can autofill with the password obfuscated. The tech wouldn't need to SEE the password, just fill it via the program. This way they can have access to everything and upon departure, have nothing they could take with them.\\n\\nIs this a product that exists that does that?...</td>\n",

To up til now I've had way better results when it comes to developing websites and web applications compared to being an employee: better performance, speed, accessibility, less bugs, etc. I'm just more productive doing freelancing. And normally, being happy makes a human more productive. Compared to being an employee, I feel like I am doing true craftsmanship: building apps for my clients from zero to the last feature. And later on extending them even more. And I am not only talking about making simple websites with WordPress. Some of my mid-large sized projects are custom made with code like Next.js and Laravel.

       "0  Lots of posts on password managers (currently use Bitwarden), but I am failing to find the solution for password management obfuscation for techs.\\n\\nThe Problem: All techs need access to 'crown jewel' passwords for our techs. GDAP for Microsoft is too feature limiting for our client base on the agility we need and we put security in place to CYA on this but, also is just MS using this partner portal. We have many vendors we want to employ this for. We are looking to avoid if a privileged or tenured tech leaves, we have to change the 'it' privileged account for each client so they don't have these when outside of the company.\\n\\nMy theory is that is would be great to supply the techs access to all passwords, but they can autofill with the password obfuscated. The tech wouldn't need to SEE the password, just fill it via the program. This way they can have access to everything and upon departure, have nothing they could take with them.\\n\\nIs this a product that exists that does that?...  \n",

       "3  Hello everyone\\n\\nSo about a year ago, I wanted to make a transition from being a full-time employee to being a freelancer. First I've created many social media accounts, spread my business word-by-mouth and developed my own [website](https://webdevamin.com). I have to say that I am really happy I've took the step. To up til now I've had way better results when it comes to developing websites and web applications compared to being an employee: better performance, speed, accessibility, less bugs, etc. I'm just more productive doing freelancing. And normally, being happy makes a human more productive. Compared to being an employee, I feel like I am doing true craftsmanship: building apps for my clients from zero to the last feature. And later on extending them even more. And I am not only talking about making simple websites with WordPress. Some of my mid-large sized projects are custom made with code like Next.js and Laravel. I like to keep my clients under contact so they always co...  \n",

So I have a full stack app (vue frontend, express rest api backend) and I want to log into the vue frontend using an authentication endpoint on my backend.  It's an internal application so I want to use OAuth to let users log in with their Microsoft 365 accounts.  On the backend I have `passportjs` setup with the `passport-microsoft` strategy.  Technically it works, I can open my browser and enter the url end point I've setup on my backend (.../api/auth/microsoft).  I can log in with Microsoft and it calls the callback function configured (.../api/auth/microsoft/callback).  It will then check my database to see if the user has logged in before, if not it will create the user.  Then when (or if) the user exists, it stores the session in my database (using `express-session`).

       "0  Sending accessToken from backend api route to frontend when logging in with passportjs (microsoft strategy). Hi.  So I have a full stack app (vue frontend, express rest api backend) and I want to log into the vue frontend using an authentication endpoint on my backend.  It's an internal application so I want to use OAuth to let users log in with their Microsoft 365 accounts.  On the backend I have `passportjs` setup with the `passport-microsoft` strategy.  Technically it works, I can open my browser and enter the url end point I've setup on my backend (.../api/auth/microsoft).  I can log in with Microsoft and it calls the callback function configured (.../api/auth/microsoft/callback).  It will then check my database to see if the user has logged in before, if not it will create the user.  Then when (or if) the user exists, it stores the session in my database (using `express-session`).  Since I'm calling the route directly in the browser it just returns a JSON object with a success...   \n",

Dear u/daddy_spez\\n\\nSomeone tried to log into a Venmo account of mine 3 days ago. I didn't do anything because I can't even log into it, the attached phone number is disconnected. Today I got a notification at 3AM that someone attempted to log into one of my Gmail accounts, so I changed the password. At 6PM someone tried to log into the Microsoft account attached to a completely different Gmail. It provided their IP, it was a VPN connected to Chicago.\\n\\nI checked haveibeenpwned and neither account was involved in a recent data breach. A couple months ago, someone also accessed my Gmail and Google Drive for one of those emails, and I changed the password.\\n\\nI scanned with Malwarebytes and no viruses were detected. I also use an iPhone. I don't think they can be infected with RATs or anything similar, but feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.   \n",

Hello, I've been trying to apply for remote assistant positions, and I applied to one and now I have a ton of deliverables to give out before the interview.

       "3  Mbox file access for users on local network. Hi all,  \\n\\n\\nIn my company we use google workspace. When a user leaves I close their account and export all their emails as an mbox file which I then archive. \\n\\nOccasionally I get requests to go looking inside those old employee emails so I end up downloading the corresponding mbox file, opening it in thunderbird on my local machine and fulfilling my request that way.I don't then share these files and attach them to mail accounts as the old users emails and the new users emails become intermingled and it's been a mess in the past to find stuff when needed.  \\n\\n\\nIs there some smarter way to manage these emails such that I can make the right defunct-user-accounts emails available to the right users at the right time?
